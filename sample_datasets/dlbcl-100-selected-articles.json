            "abstract":"Improved insight into the molecular mechanisms of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is required to predict prognosis and develop a new therapeutic strategy for targeted genes. The aim of this study is to identify significant genes associated with HNSCC and to further analyze its prognostic significance. In our study, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) HNSCC database and the gene expression profiles of GSE6631 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to explore the differential co-expression genes in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. A total of 29 differential co-expression genes were screened out by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analysis methods. As suggested in functional annotation analysis using the R clusterProfiler package, these genes were mainly enriched in epidermis development and differentiation (biological process), apical plasma membrane and cell-cell junction (cellular component), and enzyme inhibitor activity (molecular function). Furthermore, in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 21 nodes and 25 edges, the ten hub genes (S100A8, S100A9, IL1RN, CSTA, ANXA1, KRT4, TGM3, SCEL, PPL, and PSCA) were identified using the CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. The expression of the ten hub genes were all downregulated in HNSCC tissues compared with normal tissues. Based on survival analysis, the lower expression of CSTA was associated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with HNSCC. Finally, the protein level of CSTA, which was validated by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, was down-regulated consistently with mRNA levels in head and neck cancer samples. In summary, our study demonstrated that a survival-related gene is highly correlated with head and neck cancer development. Thus, CSTA may play important roles in the progression of head and neck cancer and serve as a potential biomarker for future diagnosis and treatment.",

            "abstract":"The precise mechanism through which macroautophagy/autophagy affects psoriasis is poorly understood. Here, we found that keratinocyte (KC) autophagy, which was positively correlated with psoriatic severity in patients and mouse models and could be inhibited by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family inactivation. The impairment of autophagic flux alleviated psoriasisform inflammation. We also found that an autophagy-based unconventional secretory pathway (autosecretion) dependent on ATG5 (autophagy related 5) and GORASP2 (golgi reassembly stacking protein 2) promoted psoriasiform KC inflammation. Moreover, the alarmin HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) was more effective than other autosecretory proteins in regulating psoriasiform cutaneous inflammation. HMGB1 neutralization in autophagy-efficient KCs eliminated the differences in psoriasiform inflammation between Krt14+/+-Atg5f/f KCs and Krt14Cre/+-atg5f/f KCs, and conversely, recombinant HMGB1 almost completely restored psoriasiform inflammation in Krt14Cre/+-atg5f/f KCs in vivo. These results suggest that HMGB1-associated autosecretion plays a pivotal role in cutaneous in\ufb02ammation. Finally, we demonstrated that Krt14Cre/+-hmgb1f/f mice displayed attenuated psoriatic in\ufb02ammation due to the essential crosstalk between KC-specific HMGB1-associated autosecretion and \u03b3\u03b4T cells. Thus, this study uncovered a novel autophagy mechanism in psoriasis pathogenesis, and the findings imply the clinical significance of investigating and treating psoriasis.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; ACTB: actin beta; AGER: advanced glycosylation end-product specific receptor; Anti-HMGB1: anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody; Anti-IL18: anti-IL18 neutralizing antibody; Anti-IL1B: anti-IL1B neutralizing antibody; ATG5: autophagy related 5; BAF: bafilomycin A1; BECN1: beclin 1; CASP1: caspase 1; CCL: C-C motif chemokine ligand; CsA: cyclosporine A; ctrl shRNA: lentivirus harboring shRNA against control; CXCL: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand; DCs: dendritic cells; DMEM: dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EM: electron microscopy; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GORASP2 shRNA: lentivirus harboring shRNA against GORASP2; GORASP2/GRASP55: golgi reassembly stacking protein 2; GR1: a composite epitope between LY6 (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex) locus C1 and LY6 locus G6D antigens; H&E: hematoxylin and eosin; HMGB1: high mobility group box 1; HMGB1 shRNA: lentivirus harboring shRNA against HMGB1; IFNG/IFN-\u03b3: interferon gamma; IL17A: interleukin 17A; IL18: interleukin 18; IL1A/IL-1\u03b1: interleukin 1 alpha; IL1B/IL-1\u03b2: interleukin 1 beta; IL22/IL-22: interleukin 22; IL23A: interleukin 23 subunit alpha; IL23R: interleukin 23 receptor; IMQ: imiquimod; ITGAM/CD11B: integrin subunit alpha M; ITGAX/CD11C: integrin subunit alpha X; IVL: involucrin; KC: keratinocyte; KD: knockdown; KO: knockout; Krt14+/+-Atg5f/f mice: mice bearing an Atg5 flox allele, in which exon 3 of the Atg5 gene is flanked by two loxP sites; Krt14+/+-Hmgb1f/f: mice bearing an Hmgb1 flox allele, in which exon 2 to 4 of the Hmgb1 gene is flanked by two loxP sites; Krt14Cre/+-atg5f/f mice: keratinocyte-specific atg5 knockout mice generated by mating Atg5-floxed mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the promoter of Krt4; Krt14Cre/+-hmgb1f/f mice: keratinocyte-specific hmgb1 knockout mice generated by mating Hmgb1-floxed mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the promoter of Krt14; Krt14-Vegfa mice: mice expressing 164-amino acid Vegfa splice variant recombinase under the control of promoter of Krt14; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LORICRIN: loricrin cornified envelope precursor protein; M5: TNF, IL1A, IL17A, IL22 and OSM in combination; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKI67: marker of proliferation Ki-67; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; NFKB/NF-\u03baB: nuclear factor kappa B; NHEKs: primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes; NS: not significant; OSM: oncostatin M; PASI: psoriasis area and severity index; PtdIns3K: class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; qRT-PCR: quantitative RT-PCR; RELA/p65: RELA proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit; rHMGB1: recombinant HMGB1; rIL18: recombinant interleukin 18; rIL1B: recombinant interleukin 1 beta; S100A: S100 calcium binding protein A; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; T17: IL17A-producing T; TCR: T-cell receptor; tcrd KO mice: tcrd (T cell receptor delta chain) knockout mice, which show deficient receptor expression in all adult lymphoid and epithelial organs; TLR: toll-like receptor; TNF/TNF-\u03b1: tumor necrosis factor; WOR: wortmannin; WT: wild-type; \u03b3\u03b4T17 cells: IL17A-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.",

            "abstract":"Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a less invasive therapy compared with surgery for some types of cancer; however, the 5\u2011year survival rate of patients with stages II\u2011III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is only 37%. Therefore, prediction of CRT responders is necessary. Unfortunately, no definitive biomarker exists that is useful to predict survival outcome following CRT. From our previous microarray study, CD24 and keratin 4 (KRT4), which encodes cytokeratin 4 (CK4), were overexpressed in the favorable prognostic epithelial subtype with SIM bHLH transcription factor 2 (SIM2) expression. This study investigated the association between their mRNA and protein expression levels, and clinicopathological characteristics, and also investigated the functions of CD24 in SIM2\u2011mediated tumor differentiation and CRT sensitivity. High CD24 and KRT4 mRNA expression was associated with a favorable prognosis following CRT. Multivariate analyses revealed that high CD24 and CK4 protein expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry, and differentiated type were independent factors for predicting a favorable prognosis in response to CRT. Notably, in cases with low CD24 or CK4, surgery was suggested to be a good therapeutic modality compared with CRT. CD24 and KRT4 were expressed preferentially in differentiated layers of the normal esophageal mucosa, and their mRNA expression in 3D cultured ESCC cells was induced by SIM2 transfection, thus suggesting that CD24 and KRT4 were downstream differentiation markers of SIM2. Furthermore, CD24 small interfering RNA increased the mRNA expression levels of superoxide dismutase 2 and enhanced H2O2 resistance, thus indicating the involvement of CD24 in the radiosensitivity of patients with ESCC; however, it had no effect on cisplatin sensitivity. In conclusion, the two markers CD24 and CK4 may be considered predictive biomarkers for definitive CRT.",

Upregulated USP1 expression in primary breast cancer specimens correlates with metastatic progression and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. USP1 enhances the expression of a number of pro-metastatic genes in breast cancer cells, promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro, and facilitates lung metastasis of breast cancer cells. Moreover, USP1-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of KPNA2 are revealed as the downstream events crucial for USP1-pro-metastatic function. Most importantly, pharmacological intervention of USP1 function by pimozide or ML323 significantly represses breast cancer metastasis in mice, suggesting a rationale for using USP1 inhibitors for treatment of patients with breast cancer.

Aberrant increase of KPNA2 level is identified as a prognostic marker in a variety of cancers. Yet, the turnover mechanism of KPNA2 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that KPNA2 is degraded via the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and that Zika virus (ZIKV) enhances the KPNA2 degradation. KPNA2 contains a CMA motif, which possesses an indispensable residue Gln109 for the CMA-mediated degradation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of LAMP2A, a vital component of the CMA pathway, led to a higher level of KPNA2. Moreover, ZIKV reduced KPNA2 via the viral NS2A protein, which contains an essential residue Thr100 for inducing the CMA-mediated KPNA2 degradation.

These genes play a role in prostatic carcinogenesis, but their prognostic significance is still debated. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of ERG and KPNA2 expression, and their association to early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence in advanced PC with lymph node metastases. A series of 65 consecutive pN1 M0 R0 PC samples obtained by radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy has been analyzed for ERG and KPNA2 expression by immunohistochemistry. For each case, the following clinical data were collected: age, preoperative serum PSA levels, Gleason grade group, TNM stage, and follow-up. PC recurrence was investigated by serum PSA assay and defined by a PSA concentration >0.2 ng/mL after a nadir of <0.1 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy. ERG-positive staining was found in 25/65 cases (38%), and KPNA2 in 56/65 cases (86%); neither was detected in normal prostatic tissue. Immunohistochemical concordance was found between primary tumor and lymph node metastases in 24/25 (96%) of ERG and 53/56 (95%) of KPNA2-positive cases. The follow-up was known in all cases, and early PSA recurrence occurred in 25/65 cases (38%). ERG positivity, both alone and in conjunction with KPNA2 positivity, was strongly associated with early PSA recurrence [both ERG+ and KPNA+, odds ratio: 22.2 (95% confidence interval, 6.0-82.3); ERG+ alone odds ratio: 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 5.1-63.5); P<0.0001 for both]. KPNA2 expression was significantly associated with the tumor stage (P<0.00001). The results suggest that the ERG+ phenotype might be selected in metastasis-initiating clones. ERG and KPNA2 may have a prognostic value, and their positivity in PC might warrant more aggressive treatments.",

Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of HCC is particularly important. Here, we demonstrated the expression pattern, clinical significance, and function of Karyopherin \u03b12 (KPNA2) in HCC. The expression of KPNA2 was upregulated in tumor tissue and negatively associated with the survival time, and a significant correlation between KPNA2 expression and aggressive clinical characteristics was established. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that knockdown of KPNA2 reduced migration and proliferation capacities of HCC cells, while over-expression of KPNA2 increased these malignant characteristics. The analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts also reveals that high-KPNA2 expression is associated with poor outcome in multiple cancer types. In addition, gene sets enrichment analysis exhibited cell cycle and DNA replication as the top altered pathways in the high-KPNA2 expression group in HCC and other two cancer types. Overall, this study identified KPNA2 as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in HCC and other neoplasms, probably by regulating cell cycle and DNA replication.",

Although its contributions to inflammatory response were reported in many studies, its specific associations with immune infiltrations and immune pathways during cancer progression were unclear. Here, we aimed to identify new markers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis through KPNA2-associated immune analyses. RNA-seq expression data of HCC datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium. The gene expressions were counts per million normalized. The infiltrations of 24 kinds of immune cells in the samples were evaluated with ImmuCellAI (Immune Cell Abundance Identifier). The Spearman correlations of the immune infiltrations with KPNA2 expression were investigated, and the specific positive correlation of B-cell infiltration with KPNA2 expression in HCC tumors was identified. Fifteen genes in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) B-cell receptor signaling pathway presented significant correlations with KPNA2 expression in HCC. Among them, GRB2 and NRAS were indicated to be independent unfavorable prognostic factors for HCC overall survival. Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium HCC dataset was investigated to validate the results at protein level. The upregulation and unfavorable prognostic effects of KPNA2 and GRB2 were confirmed, whereas, unlike its mRNA form, NRAS protein was presented to be downregulated and have favorable prognostic effects. Through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic potential of the three proteins was shown. The RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) of KPNA2, NRAS, and GRB2, downloaded via The Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes, were investigated for their clinical significance in HCC at protein level. An eight-RBP signature with independent prognostic value and dysregulations in HCC was identified. All the RBPs were significantly correlated with MKI67 expression and at least one of KPNA2, GRB2, and NRAS at protein level in HCC, indicating their roles in HCC progression and the regulation of the three proteins. We concluded that KPNA2, GRB2, NRAS, and their RBPs might have coordinating roles in HCC immunoregulation and progression. They might be new markers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis predication and new targets for HCC immunotherapy.",

Here, we demonstrate that hyperactivation of the deubiquitinase USP1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Upregulated USP1 expression in primary breast cancer specimens correlates with metastatic progression and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. USP1 enhances the expression of a number of pro-metastatic genes in breast cancer cells, promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro, and facilitates lung metastasis of breast cancer cells. Moreover, USP1-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of KPNA2 are revealed as the downstream events crucial for USP1-pro-metastatic function. Most importantly, pharmacological intervention of USP1 function by pimozide or ML323 significantly represses breast cancer metastasis in mice, suggesting a rationale for using USP1 inhibitors for treatment of patients with breast cancer.

Here, we demonstrate that KPNA2 is degraded via the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and that Zika virus (ZIKV) enhances the KPNA2 degradation. KPNA2 contains a CMA motif, which possesses an indispensable residue Gln109 for the CMA-mediated degradation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of LAMP2A, a vital component of the CMA pathway, led to a higher level of KPNA2. Moreover, ZIKV reduced KPNA2 via the viral NS2A protein, which contains an essential residue Thr100 for inducing the CMA-mediated KPNA2 degradation. Notably, mutant ZIKV with T100A alteration in NS2A replicates much weaker than the wild-type virus.

            "abstract":"Most prostate cancers (PC) overexpress the ERG oncogene and karyopherin \u03b1 2 (KPNA2). These genes play a role in prostatic carcinogenesis, but their prognostic significance is still debated. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of ERG and KPNA2 expression, and their association to early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence in advanced PC with lymph node metastases. A series of 65 consecutive pN1 M0 R0 PC samples obtained by radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy has been analyzed for ERG and KPNA2 expression by immunohistochemistry. For each case, the following clinical data were collected: age, preoperative serum PSA levels, Gleason grade group, TNM stage, and follow-up. PC recurrence was investigated by serum PSA assay and defined by a PSA concentration >0.2 ng/mL after a nadir of <0.1 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy. ERG-positive staining was found in 25/65 cases (38%), and KPNA2 in 56/65 cases (86%); neither was detected in normal prostatic tissue. Immunohistochemical concordance was found between primary tumor and lymph node metastases in 24/25 (96%) of ERG and 53/56 (95%) of KPNA2-positive cases. The follow-up was known in all cases, and early PSA recurrence occurred in 25/65 cases (38%). ERG positivity, both alone and in conjunction with KPNA2 positivity, was strongly associated with early PSA recurrence [both ERG+ and KPNA+, odds ratio: 22.2 (95% confidence interval, 6.0-82.3); ERG+ alone odds ratio: 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 5.1-63.5); P<0.0001 for both]. KPNA2 expression was significantly associated with the tumor stage (P<0.00001). The results suggest that the ERG+ phenotype might be selected in metastasis-initiating clones. ERG and KPNA2 may have a prognostic value, and their positivity in PC might warrant more aggressive treatments.",

Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of HCC is particularly important. Here, we demonstrated the expression pattern, clinical significance, and function of Karyopherin \u03b12 (KPNA2) in HCC. The expression of KPNA2 was upregulated in tumor tissue and negatively associated with the survival time, and a significant correlation between KPNA2 expression and aggressive clinical characteristics was established. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that knockdown of KPNA2 reduced migration and proliferation capacities of HCC cells, while over-expression of KPNA2 increased these malignant characteristics. The analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts also reveals that high-KPNA2 expression is associated with poor outcome in multiple cancer types. In addition, gene sets enrichment analysis exhibited cell cycle and DNA replication as the top altered pathways in the high-KPNA2 expression group in HCC and other two cancer types. Overall, this study identified KPNA2 as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in HCC and other neoplasms, probably by regulating cell cycle and DNA replication.",

            "abstract":"Karyopherin \u03b12 (KPNA2) was reported to be overexpressed and have unfavorable prognostic effects in many malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although its contributions to inflammatory response were reported in many studies, its specific associations with immune infiltrations and immune pathways during cancer progression were unclear. Here, we aimed to identify new markers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis through KPNA2-associated immune analyses. RNA-seq expression data of HCC datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium. The gene expressions were counts per million normalized. The infiltrations of 24 kinds of immune cells in the samples were evaluated with ImmuCellAI (Immune Cell Abundance Identifier). The Spearman correlations of the immune infiltrations with KPNA2 expression were investigated, and the specific positive correlation of B-cell infiltration with KPNA2 expression in HCC tumors was identified. Fifteen genes in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) B-cell receptor signaling pathway presented significant correlations with KPNA2 expression in HCC. Among them, GRB2 and NRAS were indicated to be independent unfavorable prognostic factors for HCC overall survival. Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium HCC dataset was investigated to validate the results at protein level. The upregulation and unfavorable prognostic effects of KPNA2 and GRB2 were confirmed, whereas, unlike its mRNA form, NRAS protein was presented to be downregulated and have favorable prognostic effects. Through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic potential of the three proteins was shown. The RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) of KPNA2, NRAS, and GRB2, downloaded via The Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes, were investigated for their clinical significance in HCC at protein level. An eight-RBP signature with independent prognostic value and dysregulations in HCC was identified. All the RBPs were significantly correlated with MKI67 expression and at least one of KPNA2, GRB2, and NRAS at protein level in HCC, indicating their roles in HCC progression and the regulation of the three proteins. We concluded that KPNA2, GRB2, NRAS, and their RBPs might have coordinating roles in HCC immunoregulation and progression. They might be new markers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis predication and new targets for HCC immunotherapy.",

However, the underlying mechanism of DNL dysregulation remains largely unknown. Ubiquitination of proteins in hepatocytes has been shown to be widely involved in lipid metabolism of liver. Here, we revealed that Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), a deubiquitinase (DUB), played key roles in DNL through regulation of zinc finger protein 638 (ZNF638) in hepatocytes. USP7 has been shown not only to interact with and deubiquitylate ZNF638, but also to facilitate the transcription of ZNF638 via the stabilization of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). USP7/ZNF638 axis selectively increased the cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1C) through AKT/mTORC1/S6K signaling, and formed USP7/ZNF638/SREBP1C nuclear complex to regulate lipogenesis-associated enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In the mice liver steatosis model induced by fructose, USP7 or ZNF638 abrogation significantly ameliorated disease progression. Furthermore, USP7/ZNF638 axis participated in the progression of lipogenesis-associated HCC. Our results have uncovered a novel mechanism of hepatic DNL, which might be beneficial to the development of new therapeutic targets for hepatic lipogenesis-associated diseases.",

In order to investigate the molecular mode of action of RID-G, we developed a novel chemical genetic approach that combined a phage display screen with a statistical analysis of drug potency and gene expression profiles in thirty-nine cancer cell lines. Application of this method to RID-G revealed that three proteins, calmodulin (CaM), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1), and zinc finger protein 638 (ZNF638) were the candidates of direct targets of RID-G.

Detection of colorectal cancer at an early stage significantly improves patient survival. Cancer-specific autoantibodies found in sera of cancer patients can be used for pre-symptomatic detection of the disease. In this study we assess the zinc finger proteins ZNF346, ZNF638, ZNF700 and ZNF768 as capture antigens for the detection of autoantibodies in colorectal cancer. Sera from 96 patients with colorectal cancer and 35 control patients with no evidence of cancer on colonoscopy were analysed for the presence of ZNF-specific autoantibodies using an indirect ELISA. Autoantibodies to individual ZNF proteins were detected in 10-20% of colorectal cancer patients and in 0-5.7% of controls. A panel of all four ZNF proteins resulted in an assay specificity of 91.4% and sensitivity of 41.7% for the detection of cancer patients in a cohort of non-cancer controls and colorectal cancer patients. Clinicopathological and survival analysis revealed that ZNF autoantibodies were independent of disease stage and did not correlate with disease outcome. Since ZNF autoantibodies were shared between patients and corresponding ZNF proteins showed similarities in their zinc finger motifs, we performed an in silico epitope sequence analysis. Zinc finger proteins ZNF700 and ZNF768 showed the highest sequence similarity with a bl2seq score of 262 (E-value 1E-81) and their classical C2H2 ZNF motifs were identified as potential epitopes contributing to their elevated immunogenic potential.

Cell transfection was completed using Lipofectamine 2000. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of PCBP2 expression on biological behaviors of glioma cells. Western blot assay was used for the detection of pathway related proteins. Expression of PCBP2 in glioma tissues and cells were higher than that in paracancerous tissues and normal cells (both p < .01). Moreover, the elevated expression of PCBP2 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = .001) and WHO stage (p = .010). Knockdown of PCBP2 could suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote apoptosis. Besides, the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway related proteins TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad2 and p-Smad7 were decreased following the downregulation of PCBP2. PCBP2 also inhibited FHL3 expression by binding to FHL3-3'UTR. The inhibition of FHL3 could reverse the antitumor action caused by PCBP2 silencing. In vivo assay, PCBP2 was also found to inhibit the tumor growth of glioma. PCBP2 activates TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway by inhibiting FHL3 expression, thus promoting the development and progression of glioma.",

            "abstract":"It is commonly accepted that cellular protein levels are primarily determined by mRNA levels. However, discordance between protein and mRNA expression has been implicated in many pathologic conditions including oncogenesis. The mechanisms involved in this discordance are complicated and far from understood. In this study, it was observed that the expression levels of poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) mRNA and protein were diametric in breast normal and cancer cell lines, paraffin-embedded and fresh tissue specimens, consistent with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. Moreover, PCBP2 protein expression was significantly associated with disease progression and poor outcome in patients with breast cancer. Depletion of PCBP2 protein inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Forced expression of PCBP2 exhibited the opposite effect. Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that PCBP2 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) was subject to alternative splicing and polyadenylation (APA) in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Non-full-length 3'UTR PCBP2 transcripts yielded more protein than the full-length 3'UTR transcripts and enhanced the oncogenic and metastatic capacities of human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, UFD1 and NT5E were identified as genes downstream of PCBP2. PCBP2 promoted oncogenicity of breast cancer cells via upregulation of the expression of UFD1 and NT5E by direct binding to their 3'UTR-B portions. IMPLICATIONS: Findings demonstrate that APA of PCBP2 3'UTR contributes to its increased expression with subsequent promotion of breast cancer progression by regulating UFD1 and NT5E.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to measure PCBP2 messenger RNA and protein expression in glioma tissues or cells. Cell transfection was completed using Lipofectamine 2000. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of PCBP2 expression on biological behaviors of glioma cells. Western blot assay was used for the detection of pathway related proteins. Expression of PCBP2 in glioma tissues and cells were higher than that in paracancerous tissues and normal cells (both p < .01). Moreover, the elevated expression of PCBP2 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = .001) and WHO stage (p = .010). Knockdown of PCBP2 could suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote apoptosis. Besides, the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway related proteins TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad2 and p-Smad7 were decreased following the downregulation of PCBP2. PCBP2 also inhibited FHL3 expression by binding to FHL3-3'UTR. The inhibition of FHL3 could reverse the antitumor action caused by PCBP2 silencing. In vivo assay, PCBP2 was also found to inhibit the tumor growth of glioma.

Cell-mediated immune responses are probably involved in regression of precancerous lesions and the polymorphism of the genes responsible may thus have a key role in the variability of the host response. Skin warts and cancers induced in rabbits by Shope papillomavirus provide a model to test this hypothesis. We analysed a restriction-fragment-length polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II genes and T-cell receptor beta-chain genes in infected domestic rabbits. We found a strong linkage between wart regression and a DR alpha EcoRI fragment, and an increased relative risk of malignant transformation associated with a DQ alpha PvuII fragment.

MS shows a risk association with Human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DRA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3135388, which is a proxy marker for DRB1*1501. We examined the relevance of rs3135388 in childhood ALL risk along with two other HLA-DRA SNPs in two case-control groups: 114 cases and 388 controls from South Wales (UK) and 100 Mexican Mestizo cases and 253 controls. We first confirmed the correlation between rs3135388 and DRB1*1501 in HLA-typed reference cell lines. We noted a female-specific risk association in childhood ALL (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-4.5, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0009) similar to the stronger association of DRB1*1501 in females with MS. Examination of an HLA-C 5' flanking region SNP rs9264942, known to correlate with HLA-C expression, showed a protective association in girls (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0003) similar to the protective HLA-Cw*05 association in MS. In a reference cell line panel, HLA-Cw5 homozygous samples (n = 8) were also homozygous for the minor allele of the SNP. Likewise, the male-specific protective association of interferon-gamma (IFNG) SNP rs2069727 in MS was replicated with the same sex specificity in childhood ALL (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-1.0, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.03). Two other SNPs in superkiller viralicidic activity 2-like and tenascin XB that are markers for systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility showed female-specific associations but due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*15. Our observations supported the epidemiologic link between MS and childhood ALL and added the sex effect to this connection. It appears that only girls born to mothers with MS may have an increased risk of ALL. Investigating the mechanism of these sex-specific associations may help understand the pathogenesis of MS and ALL.",

HLA-DR53 is associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia at the protein level, and our previous study has shown its association with early-onset chronic myeloid leukemia only in homozygous form at the DNA level. In the present study, the homozygosity rates for DR53 were 17.5 and 13.6% in patients and controls, respectively. Ten of the 11 homozygous patients were boys. In the common ALL group (n = 40), all seven DR53 homozygous patients were boys, and among 19 girls this genotype was not observed (P = 0.006). For males, homozygosity for DR53 revealed a relative risk (RR) of 3.29 (P = 0.008) for common ALL. Five of the 11 relapsed patients were homozygous for DR53. Heterozygous frequencies for HLA-DR53 were not different between patients and controls. Homozygosity for DR53 was associated with a very high relapse rate (45.5 vs 7.7%, P = 0.002, RR = 9.1).

MS shows a risk association with Human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DRA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3135388, which is a proxy marker for DRB1*1501. We examined the relevance of rs3135388 in childhood ALL risk along with two other HLA-DRA SNPs in two case-control groups: 114 cases and 388 controls from South Wales (UK) and 100 Mexican Mestizo cases and 253 controls. We first confirmed the correlation between rs3135388 and DRB1*1501 in HLA-typed reference cell lines. We noted a female-specific risk association in childhood ALL (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-4.5, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0009) similar to the stronger association of DRB1*1501 in females with MS. Examination of an HLA-C 5' flanking region SNP rs9264942, known to correlate with HLA-C expression, showed a protective association in girls (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0003) similar to the protective HLA-Cw*05 association in MS. In a reference cell line panel, HLA-Cw5 homozygous samples (n = 8) were also homozygous for the minor allele of the SNP. Likewise, the male-specific protective association of interferon-gamma (IFNG) SNP rs2069727 in MS was replicated with the same sex specificity in childhood ALL (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-1.0, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.03). Two other SNPs in superkiller viralicidic activity 2-like and tenascin XB that are markers for systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility showed female-specific associations but due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*15. Our observations supported the epidemiologic link between MS and childhood ALL and added the sex effect to this connection. It appears that only girls born to mothers with MS may have an increased risk of ALL.

MS shows a risk association with Human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DRA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3135388, which is a proxy marker for DRB1*1501. We examined the relevance of rs3135388 in childhood ALL risk along with two other HLA-DRA SNPs in two case-control groups: 114 cases and 388 controls from South Wales (UK) and 100 Mexican Mestizo cases and 253 controls. We first confirmed the correlation between rs3135388 and DRB1*1501 in HLA-typed reference cell lines. We noted a female-specific risk association in childhood ALL (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-4.5, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0009) similar to the stronger association of DRB1*1501 in females with MS. Examination of an HLA-C 5' flanking region SNP rs9264942, known to correlate with HLA-C expression, showed a protective association in girls (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0003) similar to the protective HLA-Cw*05 association in MS. In a reference cell line panel, HLA-Cw5 homozygous samples (n = 8) were also homozygous for the minor allele of the SNP. Likewise, the male-specific protective association of interferon-gamma (IFNG) SNP rs2069727 in MS was replicated with the same sex specificity in childhood ALL (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-1.0, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.03). Two other SNPs in superkiller viralicidic activity 2-like and tenascin XB that are markers for systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility showed female-specific associations but due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*15. Our observations supported the epidemiologic link between MS and childhood ALL and added the sex effect to this connection. It appears that only girls born to mothers with MS may have an increased risk of ALL. Investigating the mechanism of these sex-specific associations may help understand the pathogenesis of MS and ALL.",

Here, we used shRNA screening and identified the metabolic enzyme, methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha (MAT2A), and the arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5, as vulnerable enzymes in cells with MTAP deletion. Metabolomic and biochemical studies revealed a mechanistic basis for this synthetic lethality. The MTAP substrate methylthioadenosine (MTA) accumulates upon MTAP loss. Biochemical profiling of a methyltransferase enzyme panel revealed that MTA is a potent and selective inhibitor of PRMT5. MTAP-deleted cells have reduced PRMT5 methylation activity and increased sensitivity to PRMT5 depletion. MAT2A produces the PRMT5 substrate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and MAT2A depletion reduces growth and PRMT5 methylation activity selectively in MTAP-deleted cells. Furthermore, this vulnerability extends to PRMT5 co-complex proteins such as RIOK1. Thus, the unique biochemical features of PRMT5 create an axis of targets vulnerable in CDKN2A/MTAP-deleted cancers.",

            "abstract":"5-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway. The MTAP gene is frequently deleted in human cancers because of its chromosomal proximity to the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A. By interrogating data from a large-scale short hairpin RNA-mediated screen across 390 cancer cell line models, we found that the viability of MTAP-deficient cancer cells is impaired by depletion of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5. MTAP-deleted cells accumulate the metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA), which we found to inhibit PRMT5 methyltransferase activity. Deletion of MTAP in MTAP-proficient cells rendered them sensitive to PRMT5 depletion. Conversely, reconstitution of MTAP in an MTAP-deficient cell line rescued PRMT5 dependence. Thus, MTA accumulation in MTAP-deleted cancers creates a hypomorphic PRMT5 state that is selectively sensitized toward further PRMT5 inhibition. Inhibitors of PRMT5 that leverage this dysregulated metabolic state merit further investigation as a potential therapy for MTAP/CDKN2A-deleted tumors.",

            "abstract":"The discovery of cancer dependencies has the potential to inform therapeutic strategies and to identify putative drug targets. Integrating data from comprehensive genomic profiling of cancer cell lines and from functional characterization of cancer cell dependencies, we discovered that loss of the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) confers a selective dependence on protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and its binding partner WDR77. MTAP is frequently lost due to its proximity to the commonly deleted tumor suppressor gene, CDKN2A. We observed increased intracellular concentrations of methylthioadenosine (MTA, the metabolite cleaved by MTAP) in cells harboring MTAP deletions. Furthermore, MTA specifically inhibited PRMT5 enzymatic activity. Administration of either MTA or a small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitor showed a modest preferential impairment of cell viability for MTAP-null cancer cell lines compared with isogenic MTAP-expressing counterparts. Together, our findings reveal PRMT5 as a potential vulnerability across multiple cancer lineages augmented by a common \"passenger\" genomic alteration.",

The current diagnostic algorithm proceeds from BAP1 immunohistochemistry to CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization. While MTAP immunohistochemistry has recently shown promise as a surrogate for CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization, it has been examined in only a few single-institution studies. Furthermore, there are no published reports on interobserver agreement or interlaboratory reproducibility for MTAP immunohistochemistry. We performed MTAP immunohistochemistry on 20 benign mesothelial lesions and 99 malignant mesotheliomas from five mesothelioma centers in four countries, and each MTAP stain was independently interpreted by four pathologists. CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization data were available for a subset of cases, and a subset of cases was subjected in MTAP immunohistochemistry in multiple laboratories to assess interlaboratory reproducibility. Interobserver agreement in MTAP immunostain interpretation was excellent for all mesothelial lesions (kappa: 0.85) and for malignant mesothelioma cases only (kappa: 0.82). Interlaboratory reproducibility was also excellent (kappa values for paired protocols: 0.77-0.89). MTAP loss by immunohistochemistry was 78% sensitive and 96% specific for CDKN2A homozygous deletion. MTAP immunohistochemistry is a reliable surrogate for CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization in diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Interobserver agreement is excellent for interpretation of MTAP staining, and protocols performed in different laboratories yield concordant MTAP staining results. Rare cases with immunohistochemical MTAP loss may retain normal CDKN2A copy number, and the MTAP staining results should be correlated with clinicopathologic findings and other ancillary studies.",

The metabolic enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2\u03b1 (MAT2A) was identified as a synthetic lethal target in MTAP-deleted cancers. We report the characterization of potent MAT2A inhibitors that substantially reduce levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and demonstrate antiproliferative activity in MTAP-deleted cancer cells and tumors. Using RNA sequencing and proteomics, we demonstrate that MAT2A inhibition is mechanistically linked to reduced protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) activity and splicing perturbations.

            "abstract":"Homozygous deletion of the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene is a frequent event in a wide variety of human cancers and is a possible molecular target for therapy. One potential therapeutic strategy to target MTAP-deleted tumors involves combining toxic purine analogues such as 6'-thioguanine (6TG) or 2'-fluoroadenine (2FA) with the MTAP substrate 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA). The rationale is that excess MTA will protect normal MTAP+ cells from purine analogue toxicity because MTAP catalyzes the conversion of MTA to adenine, which then inhibits the conversion of purine base analogues into nucleotides. However, in MTAP- tumor cells, no protection takes place because adenine is not formed. Here, we examine the effects of 6TG and 2FA in combination with MTA in vitro and in vivoIn vitro, MTA protected against both 6TG and 2FA toxicity in an MTAP-dependent manner, shifting the IC50 concentration by one to three orders of magnitude. However, in mice, MTA protected against toxicity from 2FA but failed to protect against 6TG. Addition of 100 mg/kg MTA to 20 mg/kg 2FA entirely reversed the toxicity of 2FA in a variety of tissues and the treatment was well tolerated by mice. The 2FA+MTA combination inhibited tumor growth of four different MTAP- human tumor cell lines in mouse xenograft models. Our results suggest that 2FA+MTA may be a promising combination for treating MTAP-deleted tumors.Significance: Loss of MTAP occurs in about 15% of all human cancers; the MTAP protection strategy presented in this study could be very effective in treating these cancers.

In this study, we report that loss of MTAP results in profound epigenetic reprogramming characterized by hypomethylation of PROM1/CD133-associated stem cell regulatory pathways. MTAP deficiency promotes glioma stem-like cell (GSC) formation with increased expression of PROM1/CD133 and enhanced tumorigenicity of GBM cells and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with GBM. As a combined consequence of purine production deficiency in MTAP-null GBM and the critical dependence of GSCs on purines, the enriched subset of CD133+ cells in MTAP-null GBM can be effectively depleted by inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. These findings suggest that MTAP loss promotes the pathogenesis of GBM by shaping the epigenetic landscape and stemness of GBM cells while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity for GBM therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: This study links the frequently mutated metabolic enzyme MTAP to dysregulated epigenetics and cancer cell stemness and establishes MTAP status as a factor for consideration in characterizing GBM and developing therapeutic strategies.",

            "abstract":"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive asbestos-related cancer of the serous membranes. Despite intensive treatment regimens, MM is still a fatal disease, mainly due to the intrinsic resistance to current therapies and the lack of predictive markers and new valuable molecular targets. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibition has recently emerged as a potential therapy against methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficient cancers, in which the accumulation of the substrate 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) inhibits PRMT5 activity, thus sensitizing the cells to further PRMT5 inhibition. Considering that the MTAP gene is frequently codeleted with the adjacent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) locus in MM, we assessed whether PRMT5 could represent a therapeutic target also for this cancer type. We evaluated PRMT5 expression, the MTAP status and MTA content in normal mesothelial and MM cell lines. We found that both administration of exogenous MTA and stable PRMT5 knock-down, by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), selectively reduced the growth of MTAP-deleted MM cells. We also observed that PRMT5 knock-down in MTAP-deficient MM cells reduced the expression of E2F1 target genes involved in cell cycle progression and of factors implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Therefore, PRMT5 targeting could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy against MTAP-deleted MMs.",
