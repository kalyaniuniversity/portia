Calcium signaling is essential for podocyte injury, but the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) signaling in podocytes has not been fully explored. We report that podocytes from patients with lupus nephritis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and lupus-prone and lipopolysaccharide- or adriamycin-treated mice display increased expression of CaMK IV (CaMK4), but not CaMK2. Mechanistically, CaMK4 modulated podocyte motility by altering the expression of the GTPases Rac1 and RhoA and suppressed the expression of nephrin, synaptopodin, and actin fibers in podocytes. In addition, it phosphorylated the scaffold protein 14-3-3\u03b2, which resulted in the release and degradation of synaptopodin. Targeted delivery of a CaMK4 inhibitor to podocytes preserved their ultrastructure, averted immune complex deposition and crescent formation, and suppressed proteinuria in lupus-prone mice and proteinuria in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide-induced podocyte injury by preserving nephrin/synaptopodin expression. In animals exposed to adriamycin, podocyte-specific delivery of a CaMK4 inhibitor prevented and reversed podocyte injury and renal disease. We conclude that CaMK4 is pivotal in immune and nonimmune podocyte injury and that its targeted cell-specific inhibition preserves podocyte structure and function and should have therapeutic value in lupus nephritis and podocytopathies, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.",

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in association with microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can influence gene expression. However, whether circRNAs have a role in cerebral I/R injury pathogenesis, especially soon after onset, is unclear. In this study, we used the SD rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke to examine the role of circRNAs in cerebral I/R injury. We used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to compare the expression levels of circRNAs in cerebral cortex tissue from MCAO rats during the occlusion-reperfusion latency period 3 hours after I/R injury with those in control cerebral cortices. Our sequencing results revealed that expression levels of 44 circRNAs were significantly altered after I/R, with 16 and 28 circRNAs showing significant up- and down-regulation, respectively, relative to levels in control cortex. We extended these results in vitro in primary cultured neuron cells exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) using qRT-PCR to show that levels of circ-camk4 were increased in OGD/R neurons relative to control neurons. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that several miRNAs could be associated with circ-camk4 and this prediction was confirmed in a RNA pull-down assay. KEGG analysis to predict pathways that involve circ-camk4 included the glutamatergic synapse pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and apoptosis signaling pathways, all of which are known to be involved in brain injury after I/R. Our results also demonstrate that levels of the human homolog to circ-camk4 (hsa-circ-camk4) are elevated in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to OGD/R treatment. Overexpression of hsa-circ-camk4 in SH-SY5Y cells significantly increased the rate of cell death after OGD/R, suggesting that circ-camk4 may play a key role in progression of cerebral I/R injury.",

Subsequently, their pyruvate transporter function was examined by conventional functional assays, such as those measuring growth inhibition by the toxic pyruvate analog and pyruvate uptake activity. The pyruvate transporter system comprises CstA and YbdD, which are known as a peptide transporter and a conserved protein, respectively, whose functions are associated with carbon starvation conditions. In addition to the presence of more than one endogenous pyruvate importer, it has been suggested that the E. coli genome encodes constitutive and inducible pyruvate transporters. Our results demonstrated that CstA and YbdD comprise the constitutive pyruvate transporter system in E. coli, which is consistent with the tentative genomic locus previously suggested and the functional relationship with the extracellular pyruvate sensing system. The identification of this pyruvate transporter system provides valuable genetic information for understanding the complex process of pyruvate metabolism in E. coliIMPORTANCE Pyruvate is an important metabolite as a central node in bacterial metabolism, and its intracellular levels are tightly regulated to maintain its functional roles in highly interconnected metabolic pathways. However, an understanding of the mechanism of how bacterial cells excrete and transport pyruvate remains elusive. Using high-throughput transposon sequencing followed by pyruvate uptake activity testing of the selected candidate genes, we found that a pyruvate transporter system comprising CstA and YbdD, currently annotated as a peptide transporter and a conserved protein, respectively, constitutively transports pyruvate. The identification of the physiological role of the pyruvate transporter system provides valuable genetic information for understanding the complex pyruvate metabolism in Escherichia coli.",

            "abstract":"The cst operon of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is under the transcriptional control of CsoR-like sulfurtransferase repressor (CstR). Expression of this operon is induced by hydrogen sulfide, and two components of the cst operon, cstA and cstB, protect S. aureus from sulfide toxicity. CstA is a three-domain protein, and each domain harbors a single cysteine that is proposed to function in vectorial persulfide shuttling. We show here that single cysteine substitution mutants of CstA fail to protect S. aureus against sulfide toxicity in vivo. The N-terminal domain of CstA exhibits thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST; rhodanese) activity, and a Cys66 (34)S-persulfide is formed as a catalytic intermediate in both the presence and absence of the adjacent TusA-like domain using (34)S-SO3(2-) as a substrate. Cysteine persulfides can be trapped on both C66 in CstA(Rhod) and on C66 and C128 in CstA(Rhod-TusA) when incubated with thiosulfate, sodium tetrasulfide (Na2S4), and in situ persulfurated SufS. C66A substitution in CstA(Rhod-TusA) abolishes C128 S-sulfhydration, consistent with directional persulfide shuttling in CstA. Fully reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) is predominately monomeric, and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry reveals that Cys66 and Cys128 can form a C66-C128 disulfide bond using a number of oxidants, which leads to a significant change in conformation. A competing intermolecular C128-C128' disulfide bond is also formed. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements and gel filtration chromatography of reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) reveal an elongated molecule (Rg \u2248 30 \u00c5, 21.6 kDa) where the two domains pack \"side-by-side\" that likely places Cys66 and Cys128 far apart. These studies are consistent with the low yield of C66-C128 cross-link as a mimic of a persulfide transfer intermediate in CstA, and small, but measurable persulfide transfer from Cys66 to Cys128 within the CstA(Rhod-TusA) with inorganic sulfur donors.",

The aim of this study is to identify significant genes associated with HNSCC and to further analyze its prognostic significance. In our study, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) HNSCC database and the gene expression profiles of GSE6631 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to explore the differential co-expression genes in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. A total of 29 differential co-expression genes were screened out by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analysis methods. As suggested in functional annotation analysis using the R clusterProfiler package, these genes were mainly enriched in epidermis development and differentiation (biological process), apical plasma membrane and cell-cell junction (cellular component), and enzyme inhibitor activity (molecular function). Furthermore, in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 21 nodes and 25 edges, the ten hub genes (S100A8, S100A9, IL1RN, CSTA, ANXA1, KRT4, TGM3, SCEL, PPL, and PSCA) were identified using the CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. The expression of the ten hub genes were all downregulated in HNSCC tissues compared with normal tissues. Based on survival analysis, the lower expression of CSTA was associated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with HNSCC. Finally, the protein level of CSTA, which was validated by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, was down-regulated consistently with mRNA levels in head and neck cancer samples. In summary, our study demonstrated that a survival-related gene is highly correlated with head and neck cancer development. Thus, CSTA may play important roles in the progression of head and neck cancer and serve as a potential biomarker for future diagnosis and treatment.",

However, little is known about the significance of CSTA expression in ESCC.The mRNA expression of CSTA was evaluated by qRT-PCR using 28 paired frozen samples of tumor and nontumor mucosae. The protein expression of CSTA was evaluated by the immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of ESCC samples from 59 patients who underwent surgery, and its relationship with clinical features was analyzed.The mRNA expression of CSTA was significantly decreased in ESCC compared with that in matched normal mucosa (P < .0001). The protein expression of CSTA was limited in stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum but not in stratum basal in normal esophageal mucosa. It was reduced in all ESCC tissue samples compared with normal tissues; however, CSTA expression levels in tumors showed considerable variation. Of the 59 samples, 20 did not express CSTA, whereas 39 clearly expressed it. The expression of CSTA in tumors was significantly associated with pT classification (deeper tumor invasions) (P = .0118) and advanced TNM stages (P = .0497). In CSTA-positive tumor samples, CSTA-expressing cancer cells often expressed Ki67, a proliferation marker, which was in sharp contrast to normal mucosa, where Ki67-expressing cells were limited to the basal layer and did not express CSTA.

The upstream CsrA binding site (GCACACGGAU) was used to search the Escherichia coli genomic sequence for other genes that might be regulated by CsrA. cstA contained an exact match that overlapped its Shine-Dalgarno sequence. cstA was previously shown to be induced by carbon starvation and to encode a peptide transporter. Expression of a cstA'-'lacZ translational fusion in wild-type and csrA mutant strains was examined. Expression levels in the csrA mutant were approximately twofold higher when cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) and 5- to 10-fold higher when LB was supplemented with glucose. It was previously shown that cstA is regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex and transcribed by Esigma(70). We investigated the influence of sigma(S) on cstA expression and found that a sigma(S) deficiency resulted in a threefold increase in cstA expression in wild-type and csrA mutant strains; however, CsrA-dependent regulation was retained. The mechanism of CsrA-mediated cstA regulation was also examined in vitro. Cross-linking studies demonstrated that CsrA is a homodimer. Gel mobility shift results showed that CsrA binds specifically to cstA RNA, while coupled-transcription-translation and toeprint studies demonstrated that CsrA regulates CstA synthesis by inhibiting ribosome binding to cstA transcripts.

CSTA acts as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer, however, its role in lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here we found that CSTA was down-regulated in all lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung epithelial cells. CSTA was restored in most lung cancer cell lines after treatment with demethylation agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and deacetylation agent Trichostatin. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that CSTA was partially methylated in the promoter and exon 1. In primary lung tumors, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) significantly expressed more CSTA compared to adenocarcinoma (p<0.00001), and higher expression of CSTA was significantly associated with lower tumor grade (p<0.01). CSTA stable transfection reduced the activity of cathepsin B and inhibited the ability of colony formation, migration and invasion, and enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. CSTA overexpression resulted in reduced activity of ERK, p-38, and AKT. Additionally, CSTA overexpression led to a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and prevented the TGF-\u03b21-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through inhibiting the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, our date indicate 1) epigenetic regulation is associated with CSTA gene silencing; 2) CSTA exerts tumor suppressive function through inhibiting MAPK and AKT pathways; 3) Overexpression of CSTA leads to MET and prevents TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT by modulating the MAPK pathway; 4) CSTA may be a potential biomarker for lung SCC and tumor differentiation.",

            "abstract":"The cst operon of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is under the transcriptional control of CsoR-like sulfurtransferase repressor (CstR). Expression of this operon is induced by hydrogen sulfide, and two components of the cst operon, cstA and cstB, protect S. aureus from sulfide toxicity. CstA is a three-domain protein, and each domain harbors a single cysteine that is proposed to function in vectorial persulfide shuttling. We show here that single cysteine substitution mutants of CstA fail to protect S. aureus against sulfide toxicity in vivo. The N-terminal domain of CstA exhibits thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST; rhodanese) activity, and a Cys66 (34)S-persulfide is formed as a catalytic intermediate in both the presence and absence of the adjacent TusA-like domain using (34)S-SO3(2-) as a substrate. Cysteine persulfides can be trapped on both C66 in CstA(Rhod) and on C66 and C128 in CstA(Rhod-TusA) when incubated with thiosulfate, sodium tetrasulfide (Na2S4), and in situ persulfurated SufS. C66A substitution in CstA(Rhod-TusA) abolishes C128 S-sulfhydration, consistent with directional persulfide shuttling in CstA. Fully reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) is predominately monomeric, and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry reveals that Cys66 and Cys128 can form a C66-C128 disulfide bond using a number of oxidants, which leads to a significant change in conformation. A competing intermolecular C128-C128' disulfide bond is also formed. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements and gel filtration chromatography of reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) reveal an elongated molecule (Rg \u2248 30 \u00c5, 21.6 kDa) where the two domains pack \"side-by-side\" that likely places Cys66 and Cys128 far apart. These studies are consistent with the low yield of C66-C128 cross-link as a mimic of a persulfide transfer intermediate in CstA, and small, but measurable persulfide transfer from Cys66 to Cys128 within the CstA(Rhod-TusA) with inorganic sulfur donors.",

The aim of this study is to identify significant genes associated with HNSCC and to further analyze its prognostic significance. In our study, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) HNSCC database and the gene expression profiles of GSE6631 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to explore the differential co-expression genes in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. A total of 29 differential co-expression genes were screened out by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analysis methods. As suggested in functional annotation analysis using the R clusterProfiler package, these genes were mainly enriched in epidermis development and differentiation (biological process), apical plasma membrane and cell-cell junction (cellular component), and enzyme inhibitor activity (molecular function). Furthermore, in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 21 nodes and 25 edges, the ten hub genes (S100A8, S100A9, IL1RN, CSTA, ANXA1, KRT4, TGM3, SCEL, PPL, and PSCA) were identified using the CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. The expression of the ten hub genes were all downregulated in HNSCC tissues compared with normal tissues. Based on survival analysis, the lower expression of CSTA was associated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with HNSCC. Finally, the protein level of CSTA, which was validated by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, was down-regulated consistently with mRNA levels in head and neck cancer samples. In summary, our study demonstrated that a survival-related gene is highly correlated with head and neck cancer development. Thus, CSTA may play important roles in the progression of head and neck cancer and serve as a potential biomarker for future diagnosis and treatment.",

However, little is known about the significance of CSTA expression in ESCC.The mRNA expression of CSTA was evaluated by qRT-PCR using 28 paired frozen samples of tumor and nontumor mucosae. The protein expression of CSTA was evaluated by the immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of ESCC samples from 59 patients who underwent surgery, and its relationship with clinical features was analyzed.The mRNA expression of CSTA was significantly decreased in ESCC compared with that in matched normal mucosa (P < .0001). The protein expression of CSTA was limited in stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum but not in stratum basal in normal esophageal mucosa. It was reduced in all ESCC tissue samples compared with normal tissues; however, CSTA expression levels in tumors showed considerable variation. Of the 59 samples, 20 did not express CSTA, whereas 39 clearly expressed it. The expression of CSTA in tumors was significantly associated with pT classification (deeper tumor invasions) (P = .0118) and advanced TNM stages (P = .0497). In CSTA-positive tumor samples, CSTA-expressing cancer cells often expressed Ki67, a proliferation marker, which was in sharp contrast to normal mucosa, where Ki67-expressing cells were limited to the basal layer and did not express CSTA. Furthermore, CSTA expression was observed in all 22 lymph node metastases analyzed.Relatively high levels of CSTA expression in tumors were correlated with tumor progression and advanced cancer stage, including lymph node metastasis.",

The upstream CsrA binding site (GCACACGGAU) was used to search the Escherichia coli genomic sequence for other genes that might be regulated by CsrA. cstA contained an exact match that overlapped its Shine-Dalgarno sequence. cstA was previously shown to be induced by carbon starvation and to encode a peptide transporter. Expression of a cstA'-'lacZ translational fusion in wild-type and csrA mutant strains was examined. Expression levels in the csrA mutant were approximately twofold higher when cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) and 5- to 10-fold higher when LB was supplemented with glucose. It was previously shown that cstA is regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex and transcribed by Esigma(70). We investigated the influence of sigma(S) on cstA expression and found that a sigma(S) deficiency resulted in a threefold increase in cstA expression in wild-type and csrA mutant strains; however, CsrA-dependent regulation was retained. The mechanism of CsrA-mediated cstA regulation was also examined in vitro. Cross-linking studies demonstrated that CsrA is a homodimer. Gel mobility shift results showed that CsrA binds specifically to cstA RNA, while coupled-transcription-translation and toeprint studies demonstrated that CsrA regulates CstA synthesis by inhibiting ribosome binding to cstA transcripts. RNA footprint and boundary analyses revealed three or four CsrA binding sites, one of which overlaps the cstA Shine-Dalgarno sequence, as predicted.

CSTA acts as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer, however, its role in lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here we found that CSTA was down-regulated in all lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung epithelial cells. CSTA was restored in most lung cancer cell lines after treatment with demethylation agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and deacetylation agent Trichostatin. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that CSTA was partially methylated in the promoter and exon 1. In primary lung tumors, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) significantly expressed more CSTA compared to adenocarcinoma (p<0.00001), and higher expression of CSTA was significantly associated with lower tumor grade (p<0.01). CSTA stable transfection reduced the activity of cathepsin B and inhibited the ability of colony formation, migration and invasion, and enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. CSTA overexpression resulted in reduced activity of ERK, p-38, and AKT. Additionally, CSTA overexpression led to a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and prevented the TGF-\u03b21-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through inhibiting the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, our date indicate 1) epigenetic regulation is associated with CSTA gene silencing; 2) CSTA exerts tumor suppressive function through inhibiting MAPK and AKT pathways; 3) Overexpression of CSTA leads to MET and prevents TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT by modulating the MAPK pathway; 4) CSTA may be a potential biomarker for lung SCC and tumor differentiation.",

This screening led to the identification of CstA, a conserved protein that specifically interacts with Sec24A, a component of the ERES. We found that a tagged CstA is secreted in Brucella abortus culture medium. This secretion is independent of the type IV secretion system VirB and the flagellum, suggesting that CstA is secreted through another system. We also discovered that a B. abortus cstA mutant is impaired for its association with the Sec23 ERES marker. The B. abortus cstA mutant displayed peculiar trafficking, with reduced association with LAMP1 and Calnexin 12 h post-infection in HeLa cells.

However, the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying NKTCL remain unclear. Here, we identify somatic mutations of GNAQ (encoding the T96S alteration of G\u03b1q protein) in 8.7% (11/127) of NKTCL patients, through whole-exome/targeted deep sequencing. Using conditional knockout mice (Ncr1-Cre-Gnaqfl/fl), we demonstrate that G\u03b1q deficiency leads to enhanced NK cell survival. We also find that G\u03b1q suppresses tumor growth of NKTCL via inhibition of the AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, the G\u03b1q T96S mutant may act in a dominant negative manner to promote tumor growth in NKTCL. Clinically, patients with GNAQ T96S mutations have inferior survival. Taken together, we identify recurrent somatic GNAQ T96S mutations that may contribute to the pathogenesis of NKTCL.

Glaucoma may be present at birth or develop later. Neuroimaging studies show leptomeningeal angiomatosis, supporting diagnosis. Standard treatment for Sturge-Weber syndrome includes laser treatment for the Port-wine stain, anticonvulsants, and medical or surgical treatment for the glaucoma. Prognosis depends on the extent of leptomeningeal involvement and the severity of the glaucoma.",

Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated as a link, but the mechanistic details remained unclear. We identified PKC \u03b4 and \u025b as required and sufficient to activate MAPK in GNAQ mutant melanomas. MAPK activation depends on Ras and is caused by RasGRP3, which is significantly and selectively overexpressed in response to GNAQ/11 mutation in UM. RasGRP3 activation occurs via PKC \u03b4- and \u025b-dependent phosphorylation and PKC-independent, DAG-mediated membrane recruitment, possibly explaining the limited effect of PKC inhibitors to durably suppress MAPK in UM. The findings nominate RasGRP3 as a therapeutic target for cancers driven by oncogenic GNAQ/11.",

In some patients, morphologic examination of biopsies is required for differential diagnosis between amelanotic choroidal melanoma and circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. Here, we report the results of GNAQ/GNA11 mutation analysis in samples from circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. Deep amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq, San Diego, CA, USA) of positions R183 and Q209 of GNAQ and GNA11 in tissue samples from 33 patients with histologically diagnosed circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. All patients underwent biopsy or enucleation at our clinic between 2008 and 2018. To enable detection of variant alleles at low fractions, read depth exceeded 15,000-fold. DNA for genetic analysis was prepared from either snap-frozen (n = 22) or FFPE (n = 11) tissue samples. Samples from 28/33 patients (85%) showed a somatic missense mutation of GNAQ (c.626 A > G) predicted to result in p.Q209R. Variant allele fraction was variable (range 2.3% to 28%). Variants of GNAQ resulting in p.Q209 are characteristic for circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas. It appears that the GNAQ mutation spectrum in this tumor is narrow, possibly restricted to p.Q209R. Moreover, the spectrum is distinct from that of uveal melanoma, in which alterations resulting in p.Q209R are very rare.",

However, unlike resistance, which is commonly measured using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) metric, tolerance is poorly characterized, owing to the lack of a similar quantitative indicator. This may lead to the misclassification of tolerant strains as resistant, or vice versa, and result in ineffective treatments. In this Opinion article, we describe recent studies of tolerance, resistance and persistence, outlining how a clear and distinct definition for each phenotype can be developed from these findings. We propose a framework for classifying the drug response of bacterial strains according to these definitions that is based on the measurement of the MIC together with a recently defined quantitative indicator of tolerance, the minimum duration for killing (MDK). Finally, we discuss genes that are associated with increased tolerance - the 'tolerome' - as targets for treating tolerant bacterial strains.",

The deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), which is the last enzyme in the pathway of tyrosine catabolism, results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the FAH-deficient hepatocytes and proximal renal tubular cells, and subsequently leads to liver and kidney damage. HT-1 typically manifests in infancy and is characterized by elevated plasma tyrosine levels. For children whose HT-1 is not detected by the newborn screening, liver dysfunction, such as bleeding abnormalities, hypoglycemia, ascites, edema, vomiting, irritability, and jaundice, is the dominant clinical manifestation. Progression of the liver disease can be chronic or acute, with rapid deterioration. The lifetime risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is as high as 37% in the survivors without treatment, according to previous research. Many patients also suffer from neurocognitive deficits. If untreated, survival in patients with HT-1 is less than 12 months of life; most of these children die as a result of liver failure and severe coagulopathy. The prevalence of HT-1 ranges from one in 12,000 to one in 100,000 individuals of Northern European descent. In Canada, higher prevalence (one in 1,846 live births) was observed in the Saguenay\u2013Lac Saint-Jean region in Quebec.",

            "abstract":"An open question in aggressive cancers such as melanoma is how malignant cells can shift the immune system to pro-tumorigenic functions. Here we identify midkine (MDK) as a melanoma-secreted driver of an inflamed, but immune evasive, microenvironment that defines poor patient prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Mechanistically, MDK was found to control the transcriptome of melanoma cells, allowing for coordinated activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB and downregulation of interferon-associated pathways. The resulting MDK-modulated secretome educated macrophages towards tolerant phenotypes that promoted CD8+ T cell dysfunction. In contrast, genetic targeting of MDK sensitized melanoma cells to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 treatment. Emphasizing the translational relevance of these findings, the expression profile of MDK-depleted tumors was enriched in key indicators of a good response to immune checkpoint blockers in independent patient cohorts. Together, these data reveal that MDK acts as an internal modulator of autocrine and paracrine signals that maintain immune suppression in aggressive melanomas.",
