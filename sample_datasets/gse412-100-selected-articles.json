Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation--which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.",

It is crucial for the proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells. During the past 5 years, germline heterozygous mutations in GATA2 were reported in several hundred patients with various phenotypes ranging from mild cytopenia to severe immunodeficiency involving B cells, natural killer cells, CD4+ cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (MonoMAC/DCML), and myeloid neoplasia. Some patients additionally show syndromic features such as congenital deafness and lymphedema (originally defining the Emberger syndrome) or pulmonary disease and vascular problems. The common clinical denominator in all reported cohorts is the propensity for myeloid neoplasia (myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPN], chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML], acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) with an overall prevalence of approximately 75% and a median age of onset of roughly 20 years. Three major mutational types are encountered in GATA2-deficient patients: truncating mutations prior to ZF2, missense mutations within ZF2, and noncoding variants in the +9.5kb regulatory region of GATA2. Recurrent somatic lesions comprise monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 karyotypes and mutations in SETBP1 and ASXL1 genes. The high risk for progression to advanced myeloid neoplasia and life-threatening infectious complications guide decision-making towards timely stem cell transplantation.",

A comprehensive examination of the clinical features of GATA2 deficiency is currently lacking.

Somatic mutations of the GATA2 gene are also involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Cases with GATA2 gene mutations are divided into two groups, resulting in either a quantitative deficiency or a qualitative defect in the GATA2 protein depending on the mutation position and type. In the former case, GATA2 mRNA expression from the mutant allele is markedly reduced or completely abrogated, and reduced GATA2 protein expression is involved in the pathogenesis. In the latter case, almost equal amounts of structurally abnormal and wildtype GATA2 proteins are predicted to be present and contribute to the pathogenesis.

The chromosomal rearrangements reposition a GATA2 distal hematopoietic enhancer from the original 3q21 locus to the EVI1 (also known as MECOM) locus on 3q26. Therefore, the GATA2 enhancer from one of two GATA2 alleles drives EVI1 gene expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which promotes the accumulation of abnormal progenitors and induces leukemogenesis. On the other hand, one allele of the GATA2 gene loses its enhancer, which results in reduced GATA2 expression. The GATA2 gene encodes a transcription factor critical for the generation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. GATA2 haploinsufficiency has been known to cause immunodeficiency and myeloid leukemia. Notably, reduced GATA2 expression suppresses the differentiation but promotes the proliferation of EVI1-expressing leukemic cells, which accelerates EVI1-driven leukemogenesis. A series of studies have shown that the GATA2 enhancer repositioning caused by the chromosomal rearrangements between 3q21 and 3q26 provokes misexpression of both the EVI1 and GATA2 genes and that these two effects coordinately elicit high-risk leukemia.",

For example, germline variation in GATA2, encoding a vital transcriptional regulator of multilineage hematopoiesis, creates a predisposition to bone marrow failure and acute myeloid leukemia termed GATA2 deficiency syndrome. More than 300 GATA2 variants representing missense, truncating, and noncoding enhancer mutations have been documented. Although these variants can diminish GATA2 expression and/or function, the functional ramifications of many variants are unknown. Studies using genetic rescue and knockin mouse systems have established that GATA2 mutations differentially affect molecular processes in distinct target genes and within a single target cell. Considering that target genes for a transcription factor can differ in sensitivity to altered levels of the factor, and transcriptional mechanisms are often cell type specific, the context-dependent consequences of GATA2 mutations in experimental systems portend the complex phenotypes and interindividual variation of GATA2 deficiency syndrome.

            "abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) has been recently recognized as an early biomarker to predict AKI in critically ill patients. However, the biological functions of TIMP2 remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of TIMP2 in mediating inflammation and tubular cell apoptosis in AKI. In kidney tissue taken from mice exposed to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and in human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in culture, TIMP2 expression was significantly upregulated. The expression of TIMP2 in the kidney tissue correlated with the severity of AKI in vivo. In cultured HK-2 cells, LPS challenge markedly induced cytokine release, and recombinant cytokines promoted TIMP2 expression and apoptosis. However, TIMP2 silencing ameliorated LPS-induced cytokine release, apoptosis, and cell injury. We further found that the effects of downregulation of TIMP2 on a suppression of release of inflammatory cytokines were mediated by p-P65. Stable, kidney-specific TIMP2 knockdown mice were transduced by injecting the TIMP2 knockdown lentiviral vector into kidney parenchyma. TIMP2 silencing ameliorated CLP-induced proinflammatory cytokines, kidney dysfunction as measured by serum creatinine level, and histopathological changes. Downregulation of TIMP2 showed renoprotective effects on endotoxin-induced AKI, which was associated with the anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway. Collectively, our results indicate that TIMP2 plays an important role in mediating sepsis-induced AKI through regulation of NF-\u03baB. These findings reveal the pathogenic role of TIMP2 in AKI and suggest a novel target for the treatment of AKI.",

The tissue matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor 2, also known as TIMP2, is a member of the tissue inhibitor family of metalloproteinases. Since TIMP2-mediated inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key determinant of post-MI remodeling, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of exosomes derived from TIMP2-overexpressing hucMSCs (huc-exoTIMP2) on the MI rat model. The huc-exoTIMP2 significantly improved in vivo cardiac function as measured by echocardiography and promoted angiogenesis in MI injury. It also restricted extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, as indicated by the reduced collagen deposition. In addition, huc-exoTIMP2 administration increased the in situ expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and decreased that of the proapoptotic Bax and pro-caspase-9 in the infracted myocardium. Meanwhile, huc-exoTIMP2 upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione (GSH) and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in MI models. In vitro huc-exoTIMP2 pretreatment could inhibit H2O2-mediated H9C2-cardiomyocyte apoptosis and promote human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as decrease TGF\u03b2-induced MMP2, MMP9, and \u03b1-SMA secretion by cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Besides that, huc-exoTIMP2 pretreatment also increased the expression of Akt phosphorylation in the infarcted myocardium, which may relate to a high level of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2) in huc-exoTIMP2, indicating a mechanistic basis of its action. Importantly, Sfrp2 knockdown in huc-exoTIMP2 abrogated the protective effects. Taken together, huc-exoTIMP2 improved cardiac function by alleviating MI-induced oxidative stress and ECM remodeling, partly via the Akt/Sfrp2 pathway.",

Recently dysregulation of miRNAs has received more attention because of its extensive role in OS carcinogenesis. This research was designed to verify how microRNA-93 (miR-93) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) be involved in OS development. At first, the levels of miR-93 and its predictive target gene TIMP2 were detected in OS and osteoblast cell lines, and 62 pairs OS and adjacent non-OS specimens by real-time PCR and western blot. Then, viability, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OS cell lines were examined when overexpressed or knocked down miR-93, or overexpressed TIMP2. Finally, the interaction between miR-93 and TIMP2 was evaluated using mutation, gain, and loss experiment. Our data indicated that miR-93 was increased while TIMP2 was decreased in both OS cell lines and tissues. MiR-93 high-expression and TIMP2 low-expression were related with poor overall survival and prognosis of OS patients. Overexpression or knockdown experiment indicated that miR-93 enhanced OS cell viability, invasion, and EMT expression. TIMP2 could inhibit OS cell viability, invasion, and EMT expression. Further, miR-93 directly targeted TIMP2 and negatively regulated TIMP2 level in OS cells. And up-regulation of TIMP2 reversed the effects of miR-93 in OS. Finally, miR-93 regulated the oncogenic functions in OS cells by regulating the expression of TIMP2. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-93 may exert an oncogenic function while TIMP2 may act as a tumor suppressor on OS.",

Based on GSEA, GSVA and GCN, TIMP2 was demonstrated to interact with multiple integrin pathways and involve in the regulation of EMT, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis of GC. The associations of TIMP2 expression with reduced OS and RFS of patients were declared by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and further confirmed by 1000 internal bootstrap replications and external KM plotter analysis. With multi-variate COX regression and time-dependent ROC analysis, we validated the prediction independency and capacity of TIMP2 for prognosis.

Previously reported TIMP2 study indicates an association of genic rs8179090 with IS progression in a Han Chinese population. However, there has been a lack of investigation into intragenic TIMP2 polymorphisms in IS patients. We recruited 100 Caucasian females with IS and 100 controls. Patients were subdivided accordingly to: progression rate, curve severity, joint mobility, and curve pattern. Allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was applied to evaluate nine TIMP2 polymorphisms. Distribution of genotype and allele frequency in only one polymorphism (rs11658743) differed in case-control study. Four of the polymorphisms (rs2277700, rs11077401, rs2376999, and rs4789934) showed non-equal distributions either in genotype or/and allele distributions in the patients of different progression rates. The rs11077401 was related to curve severity patients distinction and the rs8179090 distinguished patients with different joint mobility level. Two polymorphisms either differed statistically in case of curve patterns subgrouping (rs8068674 and rs8179090) or showed a slight tendency toward significance in the recessive model of allele distributions (rs9916809 and rs8179090). The remaining two polymorphisms (rs2377005, rs11658743) showed no association with either clinical or radiographic IS characteristics. The influence of the G allele of the rs8179090 on the clinical course of IS has not yet been confirmed. We identified four TIMP2 polymorphisms (rs11077401, rs2376999, rs2277700, and rs4789934) that were associated with a higher risk of the progressive IS form.

However, a definitive therapeutic target remains to be identified in this tissue compartment. As major modulators of ECM structure and function, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are highly expressed in cancer and have been shown to support tumor progression. MMP enzymatic activity is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1-4) family of proteins, suggesting that TIMPs may possess anti-tumor activity. TIMP2 is a promiscuous MMP inhibitor that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. In this study, we address inconsistencies in the literature regarding the role of TIMP2 in tumor progression by analyzing co-expressed genes in tumor vs. normal tissue. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue expression studies, focusing on breast and lung carcinomas, we analyzed the correlation between TIMP2 expression and the transcriptome to identify a list of genes whose expression is highly correlated with TIMP2 in tumor tissues. Bioinformatic analysis of the identified gene list highlights a core of matrix and matrix-associated genes that are of interest as potential modulators of TIMP2 function, thus ECM structure, identifying potential tumor microenvironment biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for further study.",

Besides that, huc-exoTIMP2 pretreatment also increased the expression of Akt phosphorylation in the infarcted myocardium, which may relate to a high level of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2) in huc-exoTIMP2, indicating a mechanistic basis of its action. Importantly, Sfrp2 knockdown in huc-exoTIMP2 abrogated the protective effects. Taken together, huc-exoTIMP2 improved cardiac function by alleviating MI-induced oxidative stress and ECM remodeling, partly via the Akt/Sfrp2 pathway.",

Recently dysregulation of miRNAs has received more attention because of its extensive role in OS carcinogenesis. This research was designed to verify how microRNA-93 (miR-93) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) be involved in OS development. At first, the levels of miR-93 and its predictive target gene TIMP2 were detected in OS and osteoblast cell lines, and 62 pairs OS and adjacent non-OS specimens by real-time PCR and western blot. Then, viability, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OS cell lines were examined when overexpressed or knocked down miR-93, or overexpressed TIMP2. Finally, the interaction between miR-93 and TIMP2 was evaluated using mutation, gain, and loss experiment. Our data indicated that miR-93 was increased while TIMP2 was decreased in both OS cell lines and tissues. MiR-93 high-expression and TIMP2 low-expression were related with poor overall survival and prognosis of OS patients. Overexpression or knockdown experiment indicated that miR-93 enhanced OS cell viability, invasion, and EMT expression. TIMP2 could inhibit OS cell viability, invasion, and EMT expression. Further, miR-93 directly targeted TIMP2 and negatively regulated TIMP2 level in OS cells. And up-regulation of TIMP2 reversed the effects of miR-93 in OS. Finally, miR-93 regulated the oncogenic functions in OS cells by regulating the expression of TIMP2. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-93 may exert an oncogenic function while TIMP2 may act as a tumor suppressor on OS.",

Previously reported TIMP2 study indicates an association of genic rs8179090 with IS progression in a Han Chinese population. However, there has been a lack of investigation into intragenic TIMP2 polymorphisms in IS patients. We recruited 100 Caucasian females with IS and 100 controls. Patients were subdivided accordingly to: progression rate, curve severity, joint mobility, and curve pattern. Allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was applied to evaluate nine TIMP2 polymorphisms. Distribution of genotype and allele frequency in only one polymorphism (rs11658743) differed in case-control study. Four of the polymorphisms (rs2277700, rs11077401, rs2376999, and rs4789934) showed non-equal distributions either in genotype or/and allele distributions in the patients of different progression rates. The rs11077401 was related to curve severity patients distinction and the rs8179090 distinguished patients with different joint mobility level. Two polymorphisms either differed statistically in case of curve patterns subgrouping (rs8068674 and rs8179090) or showed a slight tendency toward significance in the recessive model of allele distributions (rs9916809 and rs8179090). The remaining two polymorphisms (rs2377005, rs11658743) showed no association with either clinical or radiographic IS characteristics. The influence of the G allele of the rs8179090 on the clinical course of IS has not yet been confirmed. We identified four TIMP2 polymorphisms (rs11077401, rs2376999, rs2277700, and rs4789934) that were associated with a higher risk of the progressive IS form. Further genetic association studies based on suggested clinical criteria would be necessary to validate TIMP2 polymorphisms associated with the curve progression. \u00a9 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, a definitive therapeutic target remains to be identified in this tissue compartment. As major modulators of ECM structure and function, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are highly expressed in cancer and have been shown to support tumor progression. MMP enzymatic activity is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1-4) family of proteins, suggesting that TIMPs may possess anti-tumor activity. TIMP2 is a promiscuous MMP inhibitor that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. In this study, we address inconsistencies in the literature regarding the role of TIMP2 in tumor progression by analyzing co-expressed genes in tumor vs. normal tissue. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue expression studies, focusing on breast and lung carcinomas, we analyzed the correlation between TIMP2 expression and the transcriptome to identify a list of genes whose expression is highly correlated with TIMP2 in tumor tissues. Bioinformatic analysis of the identified gene list highlights a core of matrix and matrix-associated genes that are of interest as potential modulators of TIMP2 function, thus ECM structure, identifying potential tumor microenvironment biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for further study.",

Urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) has been recently recognized as an early biomarker to predict AKI in critically ill patients. However, the biological functions of TIMP2 remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of TIMP2 in mediating inflammation and tubular cell apoptosis in AKI. In kidney tissue taken from mice exposed to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and in human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in culture, TIMP2 expression was significantly upregulated. The expression of TIMP2 in the kidney tissue correlated with the severity of AKI in vivo. In cultured HK-2 cells, LPS challenge markedly induced cytokine release, and recombinant cytokines promoted TIMP2 expression and apoptosis. However, TIMP2 silencing ameliorated LPS-induced cytokine release, apoptosis, and cell injury. We further found that the effects of downregulation of TIMP2 on a suppression of release of inflammatory cytokines were mediated by p-P65. Stable, kidney-specific TIMP2 knockdown mice were transduced by injecting the TIMP2 knockdown lentiviral vector into kidney parenchyma. TIMP2 silencing ameliorated CLP-induced proinflammatory cytokines, kidney dysfunction as measured by serum creatinine level, and histopathological changes. Downregulation of TIMP2 showed renoprotective effects on endotoxin-induced AKI, which was associated with the anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway. Collectively, our results indicate that TIMP2 plays an important role in mediating sepsis-induced AKI through regulation of NF-\u03baB. These findings reveal the pathogenic role of TIMP2 in AKI and suggest a novel target for the treatment of AKI.",

The tissue matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor 2, also known as TIMP2, is a member of the tissue inhibitor family of metalloproteinases. Since TIMP2-mediated inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key determinant of post-MI remodeling, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of exosomes derived from TIMP2-overexpressing hucMSCs (huc-exoTIMP2) on the MI rat model. The huc-exoTIMP2 significantly improved in vivo cardiac function as measured by echocardiography and promoted angiogenesis in MI injury. It also restricted extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, as indicated by the reduced collagen deposition. In addition, huc-exoTIMP2 administration increased the in situ expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and decreased that of the proapoptotic Bax and pro-caspase-9 in the infracted myocardium. Meanwhile, huc-exoTIMP2 upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione (GSH) and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in MI models. In vitro huc-exoTIMP2 pretreatment could inhibit H2O2-mediated H9C2-cardiomyocyte apoptosis and promote human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as decrease TGF\u03b2-induced MMP2, MMP9, and \u03b1-SMA secretion by cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Besides that, huc-exoTIMP2 pretreatment also increased the expression of Akt phosphorylation in the infarcted myocardium, which may relate to a high level of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2) in huc-exoTIMP2, indicating a mechanistic basis of its action. Importantly, Sfrp2 knockdown in huc-exoTIMP2 abrogated the protective effects.

            "abstract":"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most frequent primary bone malignancy and affects adolescents and young adults. Recently dysregulation of miRNAs has received more attention because of its extensive role in OS carcinogenesis. This research was designed to verify how microRNA-93 (miR-93) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) be involved in OS development. At first, the levels of miR-93 and its predictive target gene TIMP2 were detected in OS and osteoblast cell lines, and 62 pairs OS and adjacent non-OS specimens by real-time PCR and western blot. Then, viability, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OS cell lines were examined when overexpressed or knocked down miR-93, or overexpressed TIMP2. Finally, the interaction between miR-93 and TIMP2 was evaluated using mutation, gain, and loss experiment. Our data indicated that miR-93 was increased while TIMP2 was decreased in both OS cell lines and tissues. MiR-93 high-expression and TIMP2 low-expression were related with poor overall survival and prognosis of OS patients. Overexpression or knockdown experiment indicated that miR-93 enhanced OS cell viability, invasion, and EMT expression. TIMP2 could inhibit OS cell viability, invasion, and EMT expression. Further, miR-93 directly targeted TIMP2 and negatively regulated TIMP2 level in OS cells. And up-regulation of TIMP2 reversed the effects of miR-93 in OS. Finally, miR-93 regulated the oncogenic functions in OS cells by regulating the expression of TIMP2. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-93 may exert an oncogenic function while TIMP2 may act as a tumor suppressor on OS.",

Previously reported TIMP2 study indicates an association of genic rs8179090 with IS progression in a Han Chinese population. However, there has been a lack of investigation into intragenic TIMP2 polymorphisms in IS patients. We recruited 100 Caucasian females with IS and 100 controls. Patients were subdivided accordingly to: progression rate, curve severity, joint mobility, and curve pattern. Allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was applied to evaluate nine TIMP2 polymorphisms. Distribution of genotype and allele frequency in only one polymorphism (rs11658743) differed in case-control study. Four of the polymorphisms (rs2277700, rs11077401, rs2376999, and rs4789934) showed non-equal distributions either in genotype or/and allele distributions in the patients of different progression rates. The rs11077401 was related to curve severity patients distinction and the rs8179090 distinguished patients with different joint mobility level. Two polymorphisms either differed statistically in case of curve patterns subgrouping (rs8068674 and rs8179090) or showed a slight tendency toward significance in the recessive model of allele distributions (rs9916809 and rs8179090). The remaining two polymorphisms (rs2377005, rs11658743) showed no association with either clinical or radiographic IS characteristics. The influence of the G allele of the rs8179090 on the clinical course of IS has not yet been confirmed. We identified four TIMP2 polymorphisms (rs11077401, rs2376999, rs2277700, and rs4789934) that were associated with a higher risk of the progressive IS form. Further genetic association studies based on suggested clinical criteria would be necessary to validate TIMP2 polymorphisms associated with the curve progression. \u00a9 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, a definitive therapeutic target remains to be identified in this tissue compartment. As major modulators of ECM structure and function, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are highly expressed in cancer and have been shown to support tumor progression. MMP enzymatic activity is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1-4) family of proteins, suggesting that TIMPs may possess anti-tumor activity. TIMP2 is a promiscuous MMP inhibitor that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. In this study, we address inconsistencies in the literature regarding the role of TIMP2 in tumor progression by analyzing co-expressed genes in tumor vs. normal tissue. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue expression studies, focusing on breast and lung carcinomas, we analyzed the correlation between TIMP2 expression and the transcriptome to identify a list of genes whose expression is highly correlated with TIMP2 in tumor tissues. Bioinformatic analysis of the identified gene list highlights a core of matrix and matrix-associated genes that are of interest as potential modulators of TIMP2 function, thus ECM structure, identifying potential tumor microenvironment biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for further study.",

            "abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) has been recently recognized as an early biomarker to predict AKI in critically ill patients. However, the biological functions of TIMP2 remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of TIMP2 in mediating inflammation and tubular cell apoptosis in AKI. In kidney tissue taken from mice exposed to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and in human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in culture, TIMP2 expression was significantly upregulated. The expression of TIMP2 in the kidney tissue correlated with the severity of AKI in vivo. In cultured HK-2 cells, LPS challenge markedly induced cytokine release, and recombinant cytokines promoted TIMP2 expression and apoptosis. However, TIMP2 silencing ameliorated LPS-induced cytokine release, apoptosis, and cell injury. We further found that the effects of downregulation of TIMP2 on a suppression of release of inflammatory cytokines were mediated by p-P65. Stable, kidney-specific TIMP2 knockdown mice were transduced by injecting the TIMP2 knockdown lentiviral vector into kidney parenchyma. TIMP2 silencing ameliorated CLP-induced proinflammatory cytokines, kidney dysfunction as measured by serum creatinine level, and histopathological changes. Downregulation of TIMP2 showed renoprotective effects on endotoxin-induced AKI, which was associated with the anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway. Collectively, our results indicate that TIMP2 plays an important role in mediating sepsis-induced AKI through regulation of NF-\u03baB. These findings reveal the pathogenic role of TIMP2 in AKI and suggest a novel target for the treatment of AKI.",

The tissue matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor 2, also known as TIMP2, is a member of the tissue inhibitor family of metalloproteinases. Since TIMP2-mediated inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key determinant of post-MI remodeling, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of exosomes derived from TIMP2-overexpressing hucMSCs (huc-exoTIMP2) on the MI rat model. The huc-exoTIMP2 significantly improved in vivo cardiac function as measured by echocardiography and promoted angiogenesis in MI injury. It also restricted extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, as indicated by the reduced collagen deposition. In addition, huc-exoTIMP2 administration increased the in situ expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and decreased that of the proapoptotic Bax and pro-caspase-9 in the infracted myocardium. Meanwhile, huc-exoTIMP2 upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione (GSH) and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in MI models. In vitro huc-exoTIMP2 pretreatment could inhibit H2O2-mediated H9C2-cardiomyocyte apoptosis and promote human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as decrease TGF\u03b2-induced MMP2, MMP9, and \u03b1-SMA secretion by cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Besides that, huc-exoTIMP2 pretreatment also increased the expression of Akt phosphorylation in the infarcted myocardium, which may relate to a high level of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2) in huc-exoTIMP2, indicating a mechanistic basis of its action. Importantly, Sfrp2 knockdown in huc-exoTIMP2 abrogated the protective effects. Taken together, huc-exoTIMP2 improved cardiac function by alleviating MI-induced oxidative stress and ECM remodeling, partly via the Akt/Sfrp2 pathway.",

Previously reported TIMP2 study indicates an association of genic rs8179090 with IS progression in a Han Chinese population. However, there has been a lack of investigation into intragenic TIMP2 polymorphisms in IS patients. We recruited 100 Caucasian females with IS and 100 controls. Patients were subdivided accordingly to: progression rate, curve severity, joint mobility, and curve pattern. Allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was applied to evaluate nine TIMP2 polymorphisms. Distribution of genotype and allele frequency in only one polymorphism (rs11658743) differed in case-control study. Four of the polymorphisms (rs2277700, rs11077401, rs2376999, and rs4789934) showed non-equal distributions either in genotype or/and allele distributions in the patients of different progression rates. The rs11077401 was related to curve severity patients distinction and the rs8179090 distinguished patients with different joint mobility level. Two polymorphisms either differed statistically in case of curve patterns subgrouping (rs8068674 and rs8179090) or showed a slight tendency toward significance in the recessive model of allele distributions (rs9916809 and rs8179090). The remaining two polymorphisms (rs2377005, rs11658743) showed no association with either clinical or radiographic IS characteristics. The influence of the G allele of the rs8179090 on the clinical course of IS has not yet been confirmed. We identified four TIMP2 polymorphisms (rs11077401, rs2376999, rs2277700, and rs4789934) that were associated with a higher risk of the progressive IS form. Further genetic association studies based on suggested clinical criteria would be necessary to validate TIMP2 polymorphisms associated with the curve progression. \u00a9 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, a definitive therapeutic target remains to be identified in this tissue compartment. As major modulators of ECM structure and function, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are highly expressed in cancer and have been shown to support tumor progression. MMP enzymatic activity is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1-4) family of proteins, suggesting that TIMPs may possess anti-tumor activity. TIMP2 is a promiscuous MMP inhibitor that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. In this study, we address inconsistencies in the literature regarding the role of TIMP2 in tumor progression by analyzing co-expressed genes in tumor vs. normal tissue. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue expression studies, focusing on breast and lung carcinomas, we analyzed the correlation between TIMP2 expression and the transcriptome to identify a list of genes whose expression is highly correlated with TIMP2 in tumor tissues. Bioinformatic analysis of the identified gene list highlights a core of matrix and matrix-associated genes that are of interest as potential modulators of TIMP2 function, thus ECM structure, identifying potential tumor microenvironment biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for further study.",

            "abstract":"E2A, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays a crucial role in determining tissue-specific cell fate, including differentiation of B-cell lineages. In 5% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the t(1,19) chromosomal translocation specifically targets the E2A gene and produces an oncogenic E2A-PBX1 fusion protein. Although previous studies have shown the oncogenic functions of E2A-PBX1 in cell and animal models, the E2A-PBX1-enforced cistrome, the E2A-PBX1 interactome, and related mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis remain unclear. Here, by unbiased genomic profiling approaches, we identify the direct target sites of E2A-PBX1 in t(1,19)-positive pre-B ALL cells and show that, compared with normal E2A, E2A-PBX1 preferentially binds to a subset of gene loci cobound by RUNX1 and gene-activating machineries (p300, MED1, and H3K27 acetylation). Using biochemical analyses, we further document a direct interaction of E2A-PBX1, through a region spanning the PBX1 homeodomain, with RUNX1. Our results also show that E2A-PBX1 binding to gene enhancers is dependent on the RUNX1 interaction but not the DNA-binding activity harbored within the PBX1 homeodomain of E2A-PBX1. Transcriptome analyses and cell transformation assays further establish a significant RUNX1 requirement for E2A-PBX1-mediated target gene activation and leukemogenesis. Notably, the RUNX1 locus itself is also directly activated by E2A-PBX1, indicating a multilayered interplay between E2A-PBX1 and RUNX1. Collectively, our study provides the first unbiased profiling of the E2A-PBX1 cistrome in pre-B ALL cells and reveals a previously unappreciated pathway in which E2A-PBX1 acts in concert with RUNX1 to enforce transcriptome alterations for the development of pre-B ALL.",

NANOG-a well-known core transcription factor-plays an important role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of stem cells. Unfortunately, the mechanism that NANOG delays mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence is not well-known until now. In our study, we showed that both ectopic NANOG expression and PBX1 overexpression (i) significantly upregulated phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and PARP1; (ii) promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and osteogenesis; (iii) reduced the number of senescence-associated-\u03b2-galactosidase- (SA-\u03b2-gal-) positive cells; and (iv) downregulated the expression of p16, p53, and p21. Western blotting and dual-luciferase activity assays showed that ectopic NANOG expression significantly upregulated PBX1 expression and increased PBX1 promoter activity. In contrast, PBX1 knockdown by RNA interference in hair follicle- (HF-) derived MSCs that were ectopically expressing NANOG resulted in the significant downregulation of p-AKT and the upregulation of p16 and p21. Moreover, blocking AKT with the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 or knocking down AKT via RNA interference significantly decreased PBX1 expression, while increasing p16 and p21 expression and the number of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells. In conclusion, our findings show that NANOG delays HF-MSC senescence by upregulating PBX1 and activating AKT signaling and that a feedback loop likely exists between PBX1 and AKT signaling.",

            "abstract":"The PBX1 homeodomain transcription factor is converted by t(1;19) chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia into the chimeric E2A-PBX1 oncoprotein. Fusion with E2A confers potent transcriptional activation and constitutive nuclear localization, bypassing the need for dimerization with protein partners that normally stabilize and regulate import of PBX1 into the nucleus, but the mechanisms underlying its oncogenic activation are incompletely defined. We demonstrate here that E2A-PBX1 self-associates through the PBX1 PBC-B domain of the chimeric protein to form higher-order oligomers in t(1;19) human leukemia cells, and that this property is required for oncogenic activity. Structural and functional studies indicate that self-association facilitates the binding of E2A-PBX1 to DNA. Mutants unable to self-associate are transformation defective, however their oncogenic activity is rescued by the synthetic oligomerization domain of FKBP, which confers conditional transformation properties on E2A-PBX1. In contrast to self-association, PBX1 protein domains that mediate interactions with HOX DNA-binding partners are dispensable. These studies suggest that oligomeric self-association may compensate for the inability of monomeric E2A-PBX1 to stably bind DNA and circumvents protein interactions that otherwise modulate PBX1 stability, nuclear localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. The unique dependence on self-association for E2A-PBX1 oncogenic activity suggests potential approaches for mechanism-based targeted therapies.",

The expression of PBX1 is abnormally high in a broad range of human tissues, and this gene plays a key role in tumour proliferation. This research intended to explore the radiosensitization of OSCC by silencing PBX1. The OSCC cell lines KYSE450 and KYSE150 were subjected to PBX1 silencing and/or irradiation (IR). Cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis were tested to evaluate the radiosensitization ability of PBX1 silencing. The levels of STAT3 and p-STAT3 in the OSCC cells were tested by Western blotting. Furthermore, KYSE150 cells with or without PBX1 silencing were xenografted into nude mice with or without radiation exposure. Concomitant PBX1 silencing and IR can obviously suppress growth and enhance radiosensitivity in OSCC cells and xenografts. Moreover, the downregulation of PBX1 inhibits the expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3. The downregulation of PBX1 may increase radiosensitivity in OSCC cells and xenografts via the PBX1/STAT3 pathway.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether they have the potential to be prognostic biomarkers in patients with BC. The expression patterns of PBXs were evaluated using Oncomine, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Gene expression-based Outcome for Breast cancer Online algorithm analyses. The prognostic value of PBX1 was determined by Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis. It was observed that, among all PBX family members, only PBX1 was significantly upregulated in BC vs. normal tissues. Meta-analysis in the Oncomine database revealed that PBX1 was significantly upregulated in invasive breast carcinoma stroma, ductal breast carcinoma, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, invasive mixed breast carcinoma and male breast carcinoma compared with normal tissues. In addition, PBX1 was significantly correlated with forkhead box protein A1. Subtype analysis indicated that PBX1 overexpression was associated with luminal-like and hormone receptor-sensitive subtypes. In the survival analysis, a high expression level of PBX1 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, luminal A and luminal B subtypes of BC.

Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression level of PBX1 in lung cancer tissues and adjacent tissues. The correlation between PBX1 expression level and clinical pathological parameters of patients were analyzed. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression level of PBX1 in human lung cancer cell lines, including A549, SPC-A1, SK-MES-1 and H1299. A549 cells were transfected with blank control (blank group), negative control (NC group) or PBX1 small interfering RNA (siRNA group), respectively. The cells apoptosis and ROS content were detected by flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of PBX1, STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and survivin in each group were detected by western blot. Results: The expression level of PBX1 mRNA in lung cancer was (2.36\u00b10.23), significantly higher than (1.02\u00b10.15) in paracancerous tissues (P<0.05). The expression level of PBX1 was correlated with lung cancer differentiation, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05). The expression levels of PBX1 in human lung cancer cells A549, SPC-A1, SK-MES-1 and H1299 were (0.454\u00b10.038), (0.403\u00b10.034), (0.311\u00b10.028) and (0.377\u00b10.035), respectively, significantly higher than (0.041\u00b10.007) of human normal lung cells MRC-5 (P<0.05). The expression level of PBX1 protein in A549 cells transfected with PBX1 siRNA was (0.082\u00b10.010), significantly lower than (0.704\u00b10.065) of the blank group (P<0.05). The apoptosis rate and ROS content of siPBX1 group were (30.78\u00b13.64)% and (51.55\u00b15.03), respectively, significantly higher than (3.92\u00b10.27)% and (22.36\u00b11.31) of blank group (P<0.05). The protein expressions of p-STAT3, Bcl-2 and survivin were (0.051\u00b10.006), (0.202\u00b10.018) and (0.068\u00b10.008), respectively, significantly lower than (0.172\u00b10.010), (0.425\u00b10.041) and (0.196\u00b10.021) of blank group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Inhibition of PBX1 expression can induce the apoptosis of lung cancer cell, the mechanism may be related to ROS production and down-regulation of STAT3 signal.",

However, the identity of the factor that can regulate NFIL3 directly during the NK-cell development is not known. Here, we reveal that pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) can upregulate the NFIL3 expression directly. We used conditional knockout mice in which PBX1 in hematopoietic cells was specifically absent. The number of NK-committed progenitor pre-NKP cells and rNKP cells was reduced significantly in the absence of PBX1, which was consistent with NFIL3 deficiency. Also, the NFIL3 expression in NK cells was decreased if PBX1 was absent. We demonstrated that PBX1 was bound directly to the promoter of Nfil3 and facilitated transcription. Upon knockout of the binding site of PBX1 in the Nfil3 promoter, mice showed fewer NK-precursor cells and NK cells, just like that observed in Nfil3 knockout mice. Furthermore, asparagine N286 in the homeodomain of PBX1 controlled the binding of PBX1 to the Nfil3 promoter. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the transcription factor PBX1 promotes the early development of NK cells by upregulating the Nfil3 expression directly.",

            "abstract":"Human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) typically regulate immune activation by binding to the human leukocyte antigen class I molecules. LILRA2, a member of the LILR family, was recently reported to bind to other unique ligands, the bacterially degraded Igs (N-truncated Igs), for the activation of immune cells. Therefore, LILRA2 is currently attracting significant attention as a novel innate immune receptor. However, the detailed recognition mechanisms required for this interaction remain unclear. In this study, using several biophysical techniques, we uncovered the molecular mechanism of N-truncated Ig recognition by LILRA2. Surface plasmon resonance analysis disclosed that LILRA2 specifically binds to N-truncated Ig with weak affinity (Kd = 4.8 \u03bcm) and fast kinetics. However, immobilized LILRA2 exhibited a significantly enhanced interaction with N-truncated Ig due to avidity effects. This suggests that cell surface-bound LILRA2 rapidly monitors and identifies bi- or multivalent abnormal N-truncated Igs through specific cross-linking to induce immune activation. Van't Hoff analysis revealed that this interaction is enthalpy-driven, with a small entropy loss, and results from differential scanning calorimetry indicated the instability of the putative LILRA2-binding site, the Fab region of the N-truncated Ig. Atomic force microscopy revealed that N truncation does not cause significant structural changes in Ig. Furthermore, mutagenesis analysis identified the hydrophobic region of LILRA2 domain 2 as the N-truncated Ig-binding site, representing a novel ligand-binding site for the LILR family. These results provide detailed insights into the molecular regulation of LILR-mediated immune responses targeting ligands that have been modified by bacteria.",

However, it has remained largely unknown why microorganisms have evolved to acquire such proteases and how the host responds to microbially degraded products. Here, we have found that immunoglobulins disrupted by microbial pathogens are specifically detected by leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A2 (LILRA2), an orphan activating receptor expressed on human myeloid cells. Proteases from Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumonia and Candida albicans cleaved the N-terminus of immunoglobulins. Identification of the immunoglobulin-cleaving protease from L. pneumophila revealed that the protease is conserved across some bacteria including Vibrio spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These microbially cleaved immunoglobulins but not normal immunoglobulins stimulated human neutrophils via LILRA2. In addition, stimulation of primary monocytes via LILRA2 inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila. When mice were infected with L. pneumophila, immunoglobulins were cleaved and recognized by LILRA2. More importantly, cleaved immunoglobulins were detected in patients with bacterial infections and stimulated LILRA2-expressing cells.

However, most of the LILRA members have not been characterized in avian species including chickens. The present study is the first attempt at cloning, structural analysis and functional characterization of two LILRAs (LILRA2 and LILRA6) in chickens. Multiple sequence alignments and construction of a phylogenetic tree of chicken LILRA2 and LILRA6 with mammalian proteins revealed high conservation between chicken LILRA2 and LILRA6 and a close relationship between the chicken and mammalian proteins. The mRNA expression of LILRA2 and LILRA6 was high in chicken HD11 macrophages and the small intestine compared to that in several other tissues and cells tested. To examine the function of LILRA2 and LILRA6 in chicken immunity, LILRA2 and LILRA6 were transfected into HD11 cells. Our findings indicated that LILRA2 and LILRA6 are associated with the phosphorylation of Src kinases and SHP2, which play a regulatory role in immune functions. Moreover, LILRA6 associated with and activated MHC class I, \u03b22-microglobulin and induced the expression of transporters associated with antigen processing but LILRA2 did not. Furthermore, both LILRA2 and LILRA6 activated JAK-STAT, NF-\u03baB, PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways and induced Th1-, Th2- and Th17-type cytokines and Toll-like receptors.

Immune receptors allow neutrophils to sense their environment, with many receptors functioning to recognize signs of infection and to promote antimicrobial effector functions. However, the neutrophil response must be tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage, and regulation is achieved by expression of inhibitory receptors that can raise activation thresholds. The leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family contain activating and inhibitory members that can up- or down-regulate immune cell activity. New ligands and functions for LILR continue to emerge. Understanding the role of LILR in neutrophil biology is of general interest as they can activate and suppress antimicrobial responses of neutrophils and because several human pathogens exploit these receptors for immune evasion. This review focuses on the role of LILR in neutrophil biology. We focus on the current knowledge of LILR expression on neutrophils, the known functions of LILR on neutrophils, and how these receptors may contribute to shaping neutrophil responses during infection.",

This dysregulation likely contributes to tip the balance toward viral persistence. Different DC subpopulations, including classical (cDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells, are subjected to concomitant inflammatory and immunoregulatory events during HIV infection, which hampers the precise characterization of their regulation through classical approaches. Here, we carried out mass cytometry analysis of blood samples from early HIV-infected patients that were longitudinally collected before and after 1 year of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Blood samples from HIV controller patients who naturally control the infection were also included. Our data revealed that plasma HIV RNA level was positively associated with a loss of cDC and pDC subpopulations that display high expression of LILR immunomodulatory receptors. Conversely, specific monocyte populations co-expressing high levels of HLA-I, 3 immunomodulatory receptors, CD64, LILRA2, and LILRB4, and the restriction factor CD317 (also known as BST2/Tetherin), were more abundant in early HIV-infection. Finally, our analysis revealed that the blood of HIV controller patients contained in a higher abundance a particular subtype of CD1c+ cDCs, characterized by elevated co-expression of CD32b inhibitory receptor and HLA-DR antigen-presentation molecules. Overall, this study unravels the modifications induced in DC and monocyte subpopulations in different HIV+ conditions, and provides a better comprehension of the immune regulation/dysregulation mechanisms induced during this viral infection.",

Although inhibitory ILT receptors have been extensively studied, however, functions and structures of ILT activating receptors have yet to be elucidated. Obtaining of sufficient amount of recombinant proteins is a requisite for the functional and structural studies of a given protein. As a technical bottleneck of the study, extracellular domains of the ILT1 form aggregation during recombinant production in the past efforts. Here, we report the large-scale stable production of ILT1 D1D2 domains through engineering of site-directed mutagenesis (R142C) that introduces a cysteine at amino acid position 142 to form a disulfide bond with the spare cys132 without topological influences of the native protein based on the known structures of the homologous ILT 2/4/11. The recombinant ILT1 D1D2 domains behave as an equilibrium of both stable dimer and monomer in solution and yield ideal crystals for structural determination. The availability of quantities of soluble ILT1 D1D2 domains provides useful reagent for further studies of its detailed structure and functions.",

LILRB1 (ILT2), LILRB2 (ILT4) and LILRA1 (LIR6) can recognize MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I or class I-like molecules, and LILRB1/HLA-A2, LILRB1/UL18 and LILRB2/HLA-G complex (extracellular domains D1D2) structures have been solved recently. The details of binding to MHC have been described. Despite high levels of sequence similarity among LILRA1, LILRA2 (ILT1), LILRA3 (ILT6) and LILRB1/B2, all earlier experiments showed that LILRA2 does not bind to MHC, but the reason is unknown. Here, we report the LILRA2 extracellular D1D2 domain crystal structure at 2.6 A resolution, which reveals structural shifts of the corresponding MHC-binding amino acid residues in comparison with LILR B1/B2, explaining its non-binding to MHC molecules. We identify some key residues with great influence on the local structure, which exist only in the MHC-binding receptors. Moreover, we show that LILRA2 forms a domain-swapped dimer. Further work with these key swapping residues yields a monomeric form, confirming that the domain-swapping is primarily amino acid sequence-specific. The structure described here supports the dimer conformation in solution observed earlier, and implies a stress-induced regulation by dimerization, consistent with its function as a heat shock promoter.",

To investigate MKK9 roles in mitochondrial respiration in Arabidopsis, MKK9DD, the active allele with mutations of Thr-201 and Ser-205 to Asp, and MKK9KR, the allele lacking MKK9 activity with a mutation of Lys-76 to Arg, were used. Results showed that the total respiratory rate (Vt), alternative pathway capacity (Valt) and cytochrome pathway capacity (Vcyt) increased under 0-100 mM NaCl treatments but decreased under 150-300 mM NaCl treatments in Col-0 callus. However, the activation of MKK9 by dexamethasone (DEX) increased Vt, Valt and Vcyt under 200 mM NaCl treatment; moreover, Valt showed more increase than Vcyt. The activation of MKK9 in MKK9DD callus sharply increased AOX protein expression under normal and NaCl conditions, but the increase was not observed in MKK9KR callus. Further results indicated that MAPK3 and MAPK6 were involved in the MKK9-induced increase of AOX protein levels. qRT-PCR results showed that MKK9-MAPK3/MAPK6 was involved in the NaCl-induced AOX1b and AOX1d expression, but only MKK9-MAPK3 was necessary for AOX2 expression; in addition, MAPK3 regulated the AOX1a transcription in an MKK9-independent manner. MKK9 positively regulated SOD and CAT activities by affecting MAPK3 and MAPK6 and negatively regulated APX and POD activities by affecting MAPK3. Moreover, MKK9 functions as a positive factor in H2O2 accumulation under salt stress. The regulation of ethylene on alternative respiration was also associated with MKK9 under salt stress. Taken together, the MKK9-MAPK3/MAPK6 pathway plays a pivotal role in increasing alternative respiration in the salt-treated Arabidopsis callus.",

            "abstract":"The majority of ovarian primordial follicles are preserved in a dormant state to maintain the female reproductive lifespan, and only a few primordial follicles are activated to enter the growing follicle pool in each wave. Recent studies have shown that primordial follicular activation depends on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-KIT ligand (KITL) signaling in pre-granulosa cells and its receptor (KIT)-phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in oocytes. However, the upstream regulator of mTORC1 signaling is unclear. The results of the present study showed that the phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase3/1 (MAPK3/1) protein is expressed in some primordial follicles and all growing follicles. Culture of 3 days post-parturition (dpp) ovaries with the MAPK3/1 signaling inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced the number of activated follicles and was accompanied by dramatically reduced granulosa cell proliferation and increased oocyte apoptosis. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that U0126 significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of Tsc2, S6K1, and rpS6 and the expression of KITL, indicating that U0126 inhibits mTORC1-KITL signaling. Furthermore, U0126 decreased the phosphorylation levels of Akt, resulting in a decreased number of oocytes with Foxo3 nuclear export. To further investigate MAPK3/1 signaling in primordial follicle activation, we used phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibitor bpV(HOpic) to promote primordial follicle activation. In this model, U0126 also inhibited the activation of primordial follicles and mTORC1 signaling. Thus, these results suggest that MAPK3/1 participates in primordial follicle activation through mTORC1-KITL signaling.",

            "abstract":"Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignances with an ever-increasing incidence and high mortality. Cross-talk between cancer cells and interstitial cells exerts significant effects on neoplasia and tumor development and is modulated in part by chemokines. CXC chemokines in the tumor microenvironment can modulate immune cell trafficking and regulate tumor cell activities, thus exerting anti-tumor immunological effects and affecting patient outcomes; however, the expression and prognostic values of CXC chemokines in RCC have not been clarified. Methods: ONCOMINE, GEPIA, UALCAN, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, DAVID 6.8, Metascape, TRRUST, LinkedOmics, and TIMER were utilized in this study. Results: The transcriptional levels of CXCL1/2/5/6/9/10/11/16 in RCC tissues were significantly elevated while the transcriptional levels of CXCL3/7/12/13 were significantly reduced. A significant correlation was found between the expression of CXC1/5/9/10/11/13 and the pathological stage of RCC patients. RCC patients with low transcriptional levels of CXCL1/2/3/5/13 were associated with a significantly better prognosis. The functions of differentially expressed CXC chemokines are primarily related to the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and the ILK signaling pathway. Our data suggest that RELA, NFKB1, and SP1 are key transcription factors for CXC chemokines, and the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK, LYN, and FYN), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK1 and MAPK3), and CSNK1D are CXC chemokine targets. We found significant correlations among the expression of CXC chemokines and the infiltration of six types of immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells). Conclusions: Our results may provide novel insights for the selection of immunotherapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma.",

In this context, the present study was designed to investigate the potential of miR-143 in the treatment of breast cancer. Results showed that miR-143 to be significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The miR-143 has inhibitory effect on CAMA-1cell growth which was manifested as significant (P < 0.05) decline in loss of viability of cancer cells. The loss of cell viability was revealed to be due to the induction of apoptotic cell death as evident from acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining assays. The apoptotic cell percentage was found to be 35.7% in miR-143 mimics transfected in comparison to 6.4% in miR-NC transfected cells. The western blot analysis showed that miR-143 caused enhancement in Bax and suppression in Bcl-2 expression in CAMA-1 cells. The miR-143 also suppressed the bone metastasis of the CAMA-1 cells by suppressing the expression of Jag1 and deactivation of the Rho-signalling pathway. The transwell assays also showed considerable anti-metastatic effects of miR-143 on CAMA-1 cells.

            "abstract":"The majority of ovarian primordial follicles are preserved in a dormant state to maintain the female reproductive lifespan, and only a few primordial follicles are activated to enter the growing follicle pool in each wave. Recent studies have shown that primordial follicular activation depends on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-KIT ligand (KITL) signaling in pre-granulosa cells and its receptor (KIT)-phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in oocytes. However, the upstream regulator of mTORC1 signaling is unclear. The results of the present study showed that the phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase3/1 (MAPK3/1) protein is expressed in some primordial follicles and all growing follicles. Culture of 3 days post-parturition (dpp) ovaries with the MAPK3/1 signaling inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced the number of activated follicles and was accompanied by dramatically reduced granulosa cell proliferation and increased oocyte apoptosis. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that U0126 significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of Tsc2, S6K1, and rpS6 and the expression of KITL, indicating that U0126 inhibits mTORC1-KITL signaling. Furthermore, U0126 decreased the phosphorylation levels of Akt, resulting in a decreased number of oocytes with Foxo3 nuclear export. To further investigate MAPK3/1 signaling in primordial follicle activation, we used phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibitor bpV(HOpic) to promote primordial follicle activation. In this model, U0126 also inhibited the activation of primordial follicles and mTORC1 signaling. Thus, these results suggest that MAPK3/1 participates in primordial follicle activation through mTORC1-KITL signaling.",

            "abstract":"Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignances with an ever-increasing incidence and high mortality. Cross-talk between cancer cells and interstitial cells exerts significant effects on neoplasia and tumor development and is modulated in part by chemokines. CXC chemokines in the tumor microenvironment can modulate immune cell trafficking and regulate tumor cell activities, thus exerting anti-tumor immunological effects and affecting patient outcomes; however, the expression and prognostic values of CXC chemokines in RCC have not been clarified. Methods: ONCOMINE, GEPIA, UALCAN, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, DAVID 6.8, Metascape, TRRUST, LinkedOmics, and TIMER were utilized in this study. Results: The transcriptional levels of CXCL1/2/5/6/9/10/11/16 in RCC tissues were significantly elevated while the transcriptional levels of CXCL3/7/12/13 were significantly reduced. A significant correlation was found between the expression of CXC1/5/9/10/11/13 and the pathological stage of RCC patients. RCC patients with low transcriptional levels of CXCL1/2/3/5/13 were associated with a significantly better prognosis. The functions of differentially expressed CXC chemokines are primarily related to the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and the ILK signaling pathway. Our data suggest that RELA, NFKB1, and SP1 are key transcription factors for CXC chemokines, and the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK, LYN, and FYN), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK1 and MAPK3), and CSNK1D are CXC chemokine targets. We found significant correlations among the expression of CXC chemokines and the infiltration of six types of immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells). Conclusions: Our results may provide novel insights for the selection of immunotherapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma.",

In this context, the present study was designed to investigate the potential of miR-143 in the treatment of breast cancer. Results showed that miR-143 to be significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The miR-143 has inhibitory effect on CAMA-1cell growth which was manifested as significant (P < 0.05) decline in loss of viability of cancer cells. The loss of cell viability was revealed to be due to the induction of apoptotic cell death as evident from acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining assays. The apoptotic cell percentage was found to be 35.7% in miR-143 mimics transfected in comparison to 6.4% in miR-NC transfected cells. The western blot analysis showed that miR-143 caused enhancement in Bax and suppression in Bcl-2 expression in CAMA-1 cells. The miR-143 also suppressed the bone metastasis of the CAMA-1 cells by suppressing the expression of Jag1 and deactivation of the Rho-signalling pathway. The transwell assays also showed considerable anti-metastatic effects of miR-143 on CAMA-1 cells.

            "abstract":"The majority of ovarian primordial follicles are preserved in a dormant state to maintain the female reproductive lifespan, and only a few primordial follicles are activated to enter the growing follicle pool in each wave. Recent studies have shown that primordial follicular activation depends on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-KIT ligand (KITL) signaling in pre-granulosa cells and its receptor (KIT)-phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in oocytes. However, the upstream regulator of mTORC1 signaling is unclear. The results of the present study showed that the phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase3/1 (MAPK3/1) protein is expressed in some primordial follicles and all growing follicles. Culture of 3 days post-parturition (dpp) ovaries with the MAPK3/1 signaling inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced the number of activated follicles and was accompanied by dramatically reduced granulosa cell proliferation and increased oocyte apoptosis. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that U0126 significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of Tsc2, S6K1, and rpS6 and the expression of KITL, indicating that U0126 inhibits mTORC1-KITL signaling. Furthermore, U0126 decreased the phosphorylation levels of Akt, resulting in a decreased number of oocytes with Foxo3 nuclear export. To further investigate MAPK3/1 signaling in primordial follicle activation, we used phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibitor bpV(HOpic) to promote primordial follicle activation. In this model, U0126 also inhibited the activation of primordial follicles and mTORC1 signaling. Thus, these results suggest that MAPK3/1 participates in primordial follicle activation through mTORC1-KITL signaling.",

            "abstract":"Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignances with an ever-increasing incidence and high mortality. Cross-talk between cancer cells and interstitial cells exerts significant effects on neoplasia and tumor development and is modulated in part by chemokines. CXC chemokines in the tumor microenvironment can modulate immune cell trafficking and regulate tumor cell activities, thus exerting anti-tumor immunological effects and affecting patient outcomes; however, the expression and prognostic values of CXC chemokines in RCC have not been clarified. Methods: ONCOMINE, GEPIA, UALCAN, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, DAVID 6.8, Metascape, TRRUST, LinkedOmics, and TIMER were utilized in this study. Results: The transcriptional levels of CXCL1/2/5/6/9/10/11/16 in RCC tissues were significantly elevated while the transcriptional levels of CXCL3/7/12/13 were significantly reduced. A significant correlation was found between the expression of CXC1/5/9/10/11/13 and the pathological stage of RCC patients. RCC patients with low transcriptional levels of CXCL1/2/3/5/13 were associated with a significantly better prognosis. The functions of differentially expressed CXC chemokines are primarily related to the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and the ILK signaling pathway. Our data suggest that RELA, NFKB1, and SP1 are key transcription factors for CXC chemokines, and the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK, LYN, and FYN), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK1 and MAPK3), and CSNK1D are CXC chemokine targets. We found significant correlations among the expression of CXC chemokines and the infiltration of six types of immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells). Conclusions: Our results may provide novel insights for the selection of immunotherapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma.",

In this context, the present study was designed to investigate the potential of miR-143 in the treatment of breast cancer. Results showed that miR-143 to be significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The miR-143 has inhibitory effect on CAMA-1cell growth which was manifested as significant (P < 0.05) decline in loss of viability of cancer cells. The loss of cell viability was revealed to be due to the induction of apoptotic cell death as evident from acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining assays. The apoptotic cell percentage was found to be 35.7% in miR-143 mimics transfected in comparison to 6.4% in miR-NC transfected cells. The western blot analysis showed that miR-143 caused enhancement in Bax and suppression in Bcl-2 expression in CAMA-1 cells. The miR-143 also suppressed the bone metastasis of the CAMA-1 cells by suppressing the expression of Jag1 and deactivation of the Rho-signalling pathway. The transwell assays also showed considerable anti-metastatic effects of miR-143 on CAMA-1 cells.

To date, no SULT1B1 allelic variants have been well-characterized. 2. While cloning SULT1B1 from human endometrial specimens, an allelic variant resulting in valine instead of leucine at the 145th amino acid position (L145V) was detected. NCBI reported this alteration as the highest frequency SULT1B1 allelic variant. 3. L145V frequency comprised 9% of 37 mixed-population human patients and was specific to African Americans with an allelic frequency of 25%. Structurally, replacement of leucine with valine potentially destabilizes a conserved helix (\u03b18) that forms the \"floor\" of both the substrate and PAPS binding domains. This destabilization results in altered kinetic properties including a four-fold decrease in affinity for PAP (3', 5'-diphosphoadenosine). Kms for 3'-phosphoadenosine- 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) are similar; however, maximal turnover rate of the variant isoform (0.86 pmol/(min*\u03bcg)) is slower than wild-type (WT) SULT1B1 (1.26 pmol/(min*\u03bcg)). The L145V variant also displays altered kinetics toward small phenolic substrates, including a diminished p-nitrophenol Km and increased susceptibility to 1-naphthol substrate inhibition. 4. No significant correlation between genotype and prostate or colorectal cancer was observed in patients; however, the variant isoform could underlie specific pathologies in sub-Saharan African carriers.",

Understanding the molecular mechanism by which the SULTs perform their function is important for optimizing future therapeutic applications. Recent evidence suggests each SULT isoform acts by a half-site reaction (HSR) mechanism, in which a single SULT dimer subunit is active at any given time. HSR requires communication through the highly conserved KxxxTVxxxE dimerization motif. In this investigation, we sought to test the intersubunit interactions of SULT1B1 as it relates to enzyme activity. We generated two populations of SULT1B1 isoforms that efficiently heterodimerize upon mixing by targeted point mutation of the KxxxTVxxxE motif to KxxxTVxxxK or ExxxTVxxxE. The heterodimer exhibited wildtype-like activity with regard to native size, thermal integrity, PAP affinity, and PAPS Km, therefore serving as a valid model for investigating SULT1B1 dimer subunit interactions. The approach granted control over each independent subunit, permitting mutation of the critical 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) binding residue Arg258 and/or the catalytic base His109 in a single subunit of the dimer. Substitution of the dysfunctional subunits for fully active subunits yielded dimeric SULT1B1 with 50% the activity of the fully competent dimer, suggesting SULT1B1 intersubunit communication does not significantly contribute to the isoform's activity. These results are a testament to the unique properties of individual SULT isoforms. The dimerization system described in this manuscript can be used to study subunit interactions in other SULT isoforms as well as proteins in other families.",

The mRNA for SULT1B1 is low for both sexes until a dramatic increase ( approximately 6-fold) occurs between 15 and 30 days of age in male rats. SULT1B1 expression then decreases to half of the maximal level by 90 days of age. The increase in SULT1B1 mRNA in female rats is less dramatic and occurs between 30 and 45 days of age. SULT1B1 mRNA expression plateaus from 45 to 90 days in female rats. Expression of SULT1B1 mRNA is comparable in adult male and female rats. RNA was isolated from hypophysectomized (HX) animals and HX animals treated with growth hormone [by either male (injection) or female (infusion) pattern], estradiol, progesterone, or testosterone. HX and HX plus growth hormone, or HX plus steroid replacement, did not alter SULT1B1 mRNA expression. Pituitary-intact rats were treated with steroidal compounds dexamethasone (DEX) and pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN). Both DEX and PCN increased expression of SULT1B1 mRNA in male rats (4- and 3-fold, respectively). However, in female rats, only PCN induced SULT1B1 mRNA (2-fold), whereas DEX did not induce SULT1B1 in female rats. Analysis of SULT1B1 protein expression indicated that only when SULT1B1 mRNA was markedly increased, that is in DEX-treated male rats, was SULT1B1 protein increased. Thus, although adult male and female rats have similar SULT1B1 mRNA expressions, the patterns develop ontogenically differently. SULT1B1 is not regulated by pituitary hormones and DEX induces SULT1B1 protein in male rats.",

            "abstract":"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a type of cancer with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Although some important genes and pathways associated with CCA have been identified, the relationship between coexpression and phenotype in CCA at the systems level remains unclear. In this study, the relationships underlying the molecular and clinical characteristics of CCA were investigated by employing weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). The gene expression profiles and clinical features of 36 patients with CCA were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, the coexpression of DEGs was determined by using the WGCNA method to investigate the correlations between pairs of genes. Network modules that were significantly correlated with clinical traits were identified. In total, 1478 mRNAs were found to be aberrantly expressed in CCA. Seven coexpression modules that significantly correlated with clinical characteristics were identified and assigned representative colors. Among the 7 modules, the green and blue modules were significantly related to tumor differentiation. Seventy-eight hub genes that were correlated with tumor differentiation were found in the green and blue modules. Survival analysis showed that 17 hub genes were prognostic biomarkers for CCA patients. In addition, we found five new targets (ISM1, SULT1B1, KIFC1, AURKB and CCNB1) that have not been studied in the context of CCA and verified their differential expression in CCA through experiments. Our results not only promote our understanding of the relationship between the transcriptome and clinical data in CCA but will also guide the development of targeted molecular therapy for CCA.",

BRAF V600E and the latter 4 markers are usually absent in the more aggressive and chemoresistant variant HCLv. To evaluate differences between HCL and HCLv, expression microarrays comparing HCL with HCLv were performed for 24694 genes using 47323 probes. Microarray data from 35 HCL and 27 HCLv purified samples showed the greatest HCL-HCLv difference in the muscle-associated gene MYF6, expressed by its 2 probes 18.5- and 10.8-fold higher in HCL than HCLv (p<0.0001). By real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR), 100% of 152 classic HCL samples were MYF6-positive, vs 5 (6%) of 90 blood donors. MYF6-expression was also detected in 18 (35%) of 51 with HCLv, 11 (92%) of 12 with HCL expressing unmutated IGHV4-34, 35 (73%) of 48 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 1 (8%) of 12 with mantle cell lymphoma. Hypomethylation status of MYF6 supported expression in HCL more than HCLv. Posttreatment blood samples becoming negative by flow cytometry remained MYF6+ by RQ-PCR in 42 (48%) of 87 HCL patients, and MYF6 RQ-PCR could detect 1 HCL in 105 normal cells. MYF6, universally expressed in HCL and in most CLL samples, may be a useful biomarker for these leukemias. Further studies are underway to determine the role of MYF6 in HCL.",

Skeletal myofibers are a principle component of the MuSC niche and are in direct contact with the muscle stem cells. Here, we show that Myf6 establishes a ligand/receptor interaction between muscle stem cells and their associated muscle fibers. Our data show that Myf6 transcriptionally regulates a broad spectrum of myokines and muscle-secreted proteins in skeletal myofibers, including EGF. EGFR signaling blocks p38 MAP kinase-induced differentiation of muscle stem cells. Homozygous deletion of Myf6 causes a significant reduction in the ability of muscle to produce EGF, leading to a deregulation in EGFR signaling. Consequently, although Myf6-knockout mice are born with a normal muscle stem cell compartment, they undergo a progressive reduction in their stem cell pool during postnatal life due to spontaneous exit from quiescence. Taken together, our data uncover a novel role for Myf6 in promoting the expression of key myokines, such as EGF, in the muscle fiber which prevents muscle stem cell exhaustion by blocking their premature differentiation.",

Identification of miRNAs involved in the regulation of muscle genes could improve our understanding of myogenesis process. In this study, we investigated the regulation of Myf6 gene by miRNAs. We showed that miR-374b specifically bound to the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of Myf6 and down-regulated the expression of Myf6 gene at both mRNA and protein level. Furthermore, miR-374b is ubiquitously expressed in the tissues of adult C57BL6 mouse, and the mRNA abundance increases first and then decreases during C2C12 myoblasts differentiation. Over-expression of miR-374b impaired C2C12 cell differentiation, while inhibiting miR-374b expression by 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotides promoted C2C12 cell differentiation.

The study aimed to investigate the effects of variants in cattle MyoD1 and Myf6 on carcass and meat traits. We screened single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of both genes in 8 cattle populations, including Simmental, Angus, Hereford, Charolais, Limousin, Qinchuan, Luxi, and Jinnan by sequencing. The G782A locus was identified in exon 1 of MyoD1 (MyoD1-BglI) as well as the T186C locus in exon 1 of Myf6 (Myf6-ApaLI). For the two SNPs, the A allele was significantly more frequent than the B allele in the populations tested. The \u03c7(2) test showed that the MyoD1-BglI locus conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the 8 populations, as did the Myf6-ApaLI locus, with the exception of the Simmental population (P > 0.05). Association analysis revealed that the MyoD1-BglI locus was significantly associated with loin muscle area (LMA) (P < 0.05), and the Myf6-ApaLI locus was significantly associated with carcass length (CL) (P < 0.05). Animals with BB and AB genotypes for the MyoD1-BglI locus had larger LMAs compared to animals with AA genotype. Individuals with BB genotype had longer CLs compared to those with AA and AB genotypes. We conclude that the two SNPs might provide useful genetic markers, opening up new possibilities for cattle breeding and improvements in gene-assisted selection.",

The molecular mechanism, especially the epigenetic mechanism, underlying these breed-specific differences is poorly known. Myogenic factor 6 (MYF6) is the most abundantly expressed myogenic factor in adult muscle. Moreover, MYF6 tends to be expressed more highly in muscle tissue of the lean selection line and is supposed to be one promising candidate gene for growth- and meat quality-related traits in adult pigs. Six months old female Duroc and Pietrain pure breed pigs were used in this study. Protein and mRNA levels of MYF6 in loin eye muscle were determined by Western blotting and quantitative Real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. The DNA methylation status of the MYF6 5'-regulatory region was determined by bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). The global Histone 4 acetylation at lysines 5 (H4K5) and 8 (H4K8) were examined by Western blotting. Pietrain pigs exhibited significant higher expression of MYF6 and hypermethylated E2F1 binding element within MYF6 5'-regulatory region as compared with Duroc pigs. Significant elevation in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression was observed in Pietrain pigs which are in agreement with hypermethylation of MYF6. Histone acetylation level at neither H4K5 nor H4K8 is significant between two breed pigs. Nevertheless, mRNA and protein expression of E2F1 were significantly elevated in the Pietrain breed. It is thus conceivable that the upregulation of MYF6 transcription in postnatal Pietrain pigs is not associated with cis-activation by epigenetic modification of MYF6 5'-regulatory region, but may be attributed to trans-activation through enriched expression of E2F1.",

Mrf4 is implicated in commitment of amniote cells to skeletal myogenesis and is also abundantly expressed in many adult muscle fibres. The specific role of Mrf4 is unclear both because mrf4 null mice are viable, suggesting redundancy with other MRFs, and because of genetic interactions at the complex mrf4/myf5 locus. We report the cloning and expression of an mrf4 gene from zebrafish, Danio rerio, which shows conservation of linkage to myf5. Mrf4 mRNA accumulates in a subset of terminally differentiated muscle fibres in parallel with myosin protein in the trunk and fin. Although most, possibly all, trunk muscle expresses mrf4, the level of mRNA is dynamically regulated. No expression is detected in muscle precursor cell populations prior to myosin accumulation. Moreover, mrf4 expression is not detected in head muscles, at least at early stages. As fish mature, mrf4 expression is pronounced in the region of slow muscle fibres.",

Compared to the preadipocyte stage (day 0), gene expression profiling demonstrated that 2013 genes were up-regulated, and 2430 genes were down-regulated at the differentiated adipocyte stage (day 13). Among these differentially expressed genes, we found the expression of MSMO1 was down-regulated at day 13, but whether it impacts adipogenesis has not been characterized. Thus, we investigated its role in adipogenesis. Results showed that overexpression of MSMO1 inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1, and led to the down-regulated expression of adipogenic marker genes, while knockdown of MSMO1 had totally opposite effects. Furthermore, interaction network model allowed us to validate an unexpected role between MSMO1 and its partner, NSDHL, in regulating adipogenesis, which plays a synergized expression pattern with MSMO1. Our findings indicate that MSMO1 and NSDHL are novel modulators of adipogenesis.",

Diagnosis can be challenging as the biochemical accumulation of methylsterols can affect global development and cause skin and ocular pathology. Herein, we describe 2 siblings from a consanguineous Turkish family with SC4MOL deficiency presenting with psoriasiform dermatitis, ocular abnormalities (nystagmus, optic hypoplasia, myopia, and strabismus), severe intellectual disability, and growth and motor delay. We undertook whole-exome sequencing and identified a new homozygous missense mutation c.81A>C; p.Asn27Thr in MSMO1. Segregation analysis in all available family members confirmed recessive inheritance of the mutation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of HCC. The microarray data GSE20948 includes 14 JFH-1- and 14 mock (equal volume of medium [control])-infected Huh7 samples. The data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. After data processing, soft cluster analyses were performed to identify co-regulated genes with similar temporal expression patterns. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses, as well as functional annotation analysis, were performed. Subsequently, combined networks of protein-protein interaction network, microRNA regulatory network, and transcriptional regulatory network were constructed. Hub nodes, modules, and five clusters of co-regulated genes were also identified. In total, 173 up and 207 down co-regulated genes were separately identified in JFH-1-infected Huh7 cells compared with those of control cells. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that up co-regulated genes were related to skeletal system morphogenesis and neuron differentiation and down co-regulated genes were related to steroid/cholesterol/sterol metabolisms. Hub genes (such as IRF1, GBP1, ICAM1, Foxa1, DHCR7, HMGCS2, and MSMO1) were identified. Transcription factors IRF1 and Foxa1 were the targets of miR-130a, miR-17-5p, and miR-20a. PPARGC1A was targeted by miR-29 family, and MSMO1 was the target of miR-23 family.

Using the total morphological scoring system (TMS), we calculated the ID10 concentration (effective dose for 10% decrease in TMS). For evaluating gene specific responses, we combined previously and newly collected transcriptomics data of rat WEC exposed to a total of twelve azoles at their ID10 for 4h. Results revealed shared expressions responses in genes involved in the retinoic acid (RA) and sterol biosynthesis pathways, which are respectively representatives of developmental toxicity and targeted fungicidal action of the azoles. Azoles with more pronounced effects on the regulation of RA-associated genes were generally characterized as more potent embryotoxicants. Overall, compounds with strong sterol biosynthesis related responses and low RA related responses were considered as more favourable candidates, as they specifically regulated genes related to a desired target response. Among the identified sterol associated genes, we detected that methylsterol monooxygenase 1 (Msmo1) was more sensitively induced compared to Cyp51, a classical biomarker of this pathway. Therefore, we suggest that Msmo1 could be a better biomarker for screening the fungicidal value of azoles. In summary, we conclude that the embryonic regulation of RA and sterol metabolic pathways could be indicators for ranking azoles as embryotoxicants and determining their drug efficacy.",

            "abstract":"Ovarian follicular development is an extremely complex and precise process in which the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis plays a crucial role. However, research on the regulatory factors of the HPO axis is sparse. In this study, transcriptomes of the tissues in the entire HPO axis at 15, 20, 30, and 68 w of age were analyzed. In total, 381, 622, and 1090 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found among the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary, respectively. In particular, the greatest number of DEGs (867) was identified from the comparison of ovary at 30 and 15 w, which might be related to ovarian development and function at high ovulation capacity. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses indicated that most of these DEGs in the significantly enriched biological process (BP) terms and pathways were primarily involved in tissue development and the regulation of reproductive hormone biosynthesis and secretion. The latter is highly related to the HPO axis. Therefore, a number of hub candidate genes strongly associated with the HPO axis in each tissue were filtered by analyzing the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and seven known reproductive hormone-associated key genes were obtained: PGR, HSD3B2, CYP17A1, CYP11A1, CYP21A2, STS, and CYP19A1, and 12 novel genes: ROCK2, TBP, GTF2H2, GTF2B, DHCR24, DHCR7, FDFT1, LSS, SQLE, MSMO1, CYP51A1, and PANK3. These will be utilized for further research into the function of the HPO axis. This study has highlighted the major role of the HPO axis in the reproduction of hens at the four developmental stages and explored the novel factors that might regulate reproduction, thus providing new insights into the function of the HPO axis on the reproductive system.",

However, some negative effects increased (abdominal fat (AF) deposition, low feed conversion, etc.) have also been reported. In this study, the gene expression profiles of AF tissue in ovariectomized and sham-operated chickens were determined to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying AF accumulation. Comparing the ovariectomized group and the sham-operated group, the abdominal fat weight (AFW) and abdominal fat percentage (AFP) were increased significantly (p < 0.05) at 14 and 19 weeks after ovariectomy. According to the gene expression profiling analysis, 108 DEGs of fat metabolism were screened from 1461 DEGs. Among them, ABCA1, ABCACA, LPL, CREB1, PNPLA2, which are involved in glycerolipid-or steroid-associated biological processes, and the hormone receptor genes, ESR1 and PRLR, were down-regulated significantly in the ovariectomized group compared to the sham-operated group (p < 0.05). Conversely, CETP, DGAT2, DHCR24, HSD17B7 and MSMO1, were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05) after ovariectomy. Based on the DEGs, the glycerolipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and other signaling pathways (MAPK, TGF-\u03b2, and adhesion pathways, etc.) were enriched, which may also contribute to the regulation of AF deposition. Our data suggest that AF deposition was significantly increased in ovariectomized chickens by the down-regulation of the decomposition genes of glycerolipid metabolism, which inhibits AF degradation, and the up-regulation of steroid biosynthesis genes, which increases fat accumulation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of fat deposition in the ovariectomized chickens.",

The binding of autoantibodies to Dsg proteins induces a separation of neighbouring keratinocytes, in a process known as acantholysis. The two main pemphigus variants are pemphigus vulgaris, which often originates with painful oral erosions, and pemphigus foliaceus, which is characterised by exclusive skin lesions. Pemphigus is diagnosed on the basis of either IgG or complement component 3 deposits (or both) at the keratinocyte cell membrane, detected by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy, with serum anti-Dsg1 or anti-Dsg3 antibodies (or both) detected by ELISA. Corticosteroids are the therapeutic mainstay, which have recently been complemented by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in moderate and severe disease. Rituximab induces complete remission off therapy in 90% of patients, despite rapid tapering of corticosteroids, thus allowing for a major corticosteroid-sparing effect and a halved number of adverse events related to corticosteroids.",

The hyperkeratosis was initially restricted to the footpads. The footpad lesions caused severe discomfort to the dog and had to be trimmed under anesthesia every 8-10 weeks. Histologically, the epidermis showed papillated villous projections of dense keratin in the stratum corneum. Starting at eight months of age, the patient additionally developed signs consistent with atopic dermatitis and recurrent bacterial skin and ear infections. Crusted hyperkeratotic plaques developed at sites of infection. We sequenced the genome of the affected dog and compared the data to 655 control genomes. A search for variants in 32 candidate genes associated with human palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) revealed a single private protein-changing variant in the affected dog. This was located in the DSG1 gene encoding desmoglein 1. Heterozygous monoallelic DSG1 variants have been reported in human patients with striate palmoplantar keratoderma I (SPPK1), while biallelic DSG1 loss of function variants in humans lead to a more pronounced condition termed severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome. The identified canine variant, DSG1:c.2541_2545delGGGCT, leads to a frameshift and truncates about 20% of the coding sequence. The affected dog was homozygous for the mutant allele. The comparative data on desmoglein 1 function in humans suggest that the identified DSG1 variant may have caused the footpad hyperkeratosis and predisposition for allergies and skin infections in the affected dog.",

Several signaling pathways were proposed to cause loss of keratinocyte adhesion. However, relevance of different signaling pathways and role of Dsg1 and 3 to trigger signaling are not fully understood. Here, we show that Ca2+ chelation reduced PV-IgG- and PF-IgG-mediated loss of HaCaT keratinocyte cohesion whereas EGFR inhibition did not inhibit effects of PF-IgG. PV-IgG activated EGFR in a Src-dependent manner whereas both PV-IgG and PF-IgG caused Ca2+ influx independent of EGFR. ERK activation was Src-dependent in response to PV-IgG but not PF-IgG. To delineate the roles of Dsg isoforms to trigger signaling pathways, Dsg3- and Dsg2-deficient HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9.

Keratinocytes and melanocytes respond to UV exposure by eliciting a tanning response dependent in part on paracrine signaling, but how keratinocyte:melanocyte communication is regulated during this response remains understudied. Here, we uncover a surprising new function for the keratinocyte-specific cell-cell adhesion molecule desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) in regulating keratinocyte:melanocyte paracrine signaling to promote the tanning response in the absence of UV exposure. Melanocytes within Dsg1-silenced human skin equivalents exhibited increased pigmentation and altered dendrite morphology, phenotypes which were confirmed in 2D culture using conditioned media from Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes. Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone precursor (Pomc) and cytokine mRNA. Melanocytes cultured in media conditioned by Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes increased Mitf and Tyrp1 mRNA, TYRP1 protein, and melanin production and secretion. Melanocytes in Dsg1-silenced skin equivalents mislocalized suprabasally, reminiscent of early melanoma pagetoid behavior. Together with our previous report that UV reduces Dsg1 expression, these data support a role for Dsg1 in controlling keratinocyte:melanocyte paracrine communication and raise the possibility that a Dsg1-deficient niche contributes to pagetoid behavior, such as occurs in early melanoma development.",

            "abstract":"Desmosomes are major intercellular adhesion junctions that provide stable cell-cell contacts and mechanical strength to epithelial tissues by anchoring cytokeratin intermediate filaments of adjacent cells. Desmogleins (Dsg) are transmembrane core components of the desmosomes, and belong to the cadherin supergene family of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules. Currently, there are three known isoforms of Dsgs (Dsg1, Dsg2, and Dsg3), encoded by distinct genes that are differentially expressed to determine their tissue specificity and differentiation state of epithelial cells. In this study, we cloned a novel mouse desmoglein gene sharing high homology to both mouse and human Dsg1. We propose to designate the previously published mouse Dsg1 gene as Dsg1-alpha and the new gene as Dsg1-beta. Analysis of intron/exon organization of the Dsg1-alpha and Dsg1-beta genes revealed significant conservation. The full-length mouse Dsg1-beta cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3180 bp encoding a precursor protein of 1060 amino acids. Dsg1-beta protein shares 94% and 76% identity with mouse Dsg1-alpha and human DSG1, respectively. RT-PCR using a multitissue cDNA panel demonstrated that while Dsg1-alpha mRNA was expressed in 15- to 17-day-old embryos and adult spleen and testis, Dsg1-beta mRNA was detected in 17-day-old embryos only. To assess subcellular localization, a FLAG-tagged expression construct of Dsg1-beta was transiently expressed in epithelial HaCaT cells. Dsg1-beta-FLAG was found at the cell-cell border and was recognized by the anti-Dsg1/Dsg2 antibody DG3.10. In summary, we have cloned and characterized a novel member of the mouse desmoglein gene family, Dsg1-beta.",

The binding of autoantibodies to Dsg proteins induces a separation of neighbouring keratinocytes, in a process known as acantholysis. The two main pemphigus variants are pemphigus vulgaris, which often originates with painful oral erosions, and pemphigus foliaceus, which is characterised by exclusive skin lesions. Pemphigus is diagnosed on the basis of either IgG or complement component 3 deposits (or both) at the keratinocyte cell membrane, detected by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy, with serum anti-Dsg1 or anti-Dsg3 antibodies (or both) detected by ELISA. Corticosteroids are the therapeutic mainstay, which have recently been complemented by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in moderate and severe disease. Rituximab induces complete remission off therapy in 90% of patients, despite rapid tapering of corticosteroids, thus allowing for a major corticosteroid-sparing effect and a halved number of adverse events related to corticosteroids.",

The hyperkeratosis was initially restricted to the footpads. The footpad lesions caused severe discomfort to the dog and had to be trimmed under anesthesia every 8-10 weeks. Histologically, the epidermis showed papillated villous projections of dense keratin in the stratum corneum. Starting at eight months of age, the patient additionally developed signs consistent with atopic dermatitis and recurrent bacterial skin and ear infections. Crusted hyperkeratotic plaques developed at sites of infection. We sequenced the genome of the affected dog and compared the data to 655 control genomes. A search for variants in 32 candidate genes associated with human palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) revealed a single private protein-changing variant in the affected dog. This was located in the DSG1 gene encoding desmoglein 1. Heterozygous monoallelic DSG1 variants have been reported in human patients with striate palmoplantar keratoderma I (SPPK1), while biallelic DSG1 loss of function variants in humans lead to a more pronounced condition termed severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome. The identified canine variant, DSG1:c.2541_2545delGGGCT, leads to a frameshift and truncates about 20% of the coding sequence. The affected dog was homozygous for the mutant allele. The comparative data on desmoglein 1 function in humans suggest that the identified DSG1 variant may have caused the footpad hyperkeratosis and predisposition for allergies and skin infections in the affected dog.",

Several signaling pathways were proposed to cause loss of keratinocyte adhesion. However, relevance of different signaling pathways and role of Dsg1 and 3 to trigger signaling are not fully understood. Here, we show that Ca2+ chelation reduced PV-IgG- and PF-IgG-mediated loss of HaCaT keratinocyte cohesion whereas EGFR inhibition did not inhibit effects of PF-IgG. PV-IgG activated EGFR in a Src-dependent manner whereas both PV-IgG and PF-IgG caused Ca2+ influx independent of EGFR. ERK activation was Src-dependent in response to PV-IgG but not PF-IgG. To delineate the roles of Dsg isoforms to trigger signaling pathways, Dsg3- and Dsg2-deficient HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9.

However, DSP and KRT1 gene mutations have been identified in some cases. In this study, fragment and sequencing analysis were performed for a large Syrian family with dominant SPPK. Segregation analysis showed a linkage with DSG1 gene. Direct Sanger sequencing identified a new mutation c.dup165_168AGCA. This frameshift mutation was heterozygous in all affected family members and absent in all normal individuals.",

Currently, there are three known isoforms of Dsgs (Dsg1, Dsg2, and Dsg3), encoded by distinct genes that are differentially expressed to determine their tissue specificity and differentiation state of epithelial cells. In this study, we cloned a novel mouse desmoglein gene sharing high homology to both mouse and human Dsg1. We propose to designate the previously published mouse Dsg1 gene as Dsg1-alpha and the new gene as Dsg1-beta. Analysis of intron/exon organization of the Dsg1-alpha and Dsg1-beta genes revealed significant conservation. The full-length mouse Dsg1-beta cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3180 bp encoding a precursor protein of 1060 amino acids. Dsg1-beta protein shares 94% and 76% identity with mouse Dsg1-alpha and human DSG1, respectively. RT-PCR using a multitissue cDNA panel demonstrated that while Dsg1-alpha mRNA was expressed in 15- to 17-day-old embryos and adult spleen and testis, Dsg1-beta mRNA was detected in 17-day-old embryos only. To assess subcellular localization, a FLAG-tagged expression construct of Dsg1-beta was transiently expressed in epithelial HaCaT cells. Dsg1-beta-FLAG was found at the cell-cell border and was recognized by the anti-Dsg1/Dsg2 antibody DG3.10.

The binding of autoantibodies to Dsg proteins induces a separation of neighbouring keratinocytes, in a process known as acantholysis. The two main pemphigus variants are pemphigus vulgaris, which often originates with painful oral erosions, and pemphigus foliaceus, which is characterised by exclusive skin lesions. Pemphigus is diagnosed on the basis of either IgG or complement component 3 deposits (or both) at the keratinocyte cell membrane, detected by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy, with serum anti-Dsg1 or anti-Dsg3 antibodies (or both) detected by ELISA. Corticosteroids are the therapeutic mainstay, which have recently been complemented by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in moderate and severe disease. Rituximab induces complete remission off therapy in 90% of patients, despite rapid tapering of corticosteroids, thus allowing for a major corticosteroid-sparing effect and a halved number of adverse events related to corticosteroids.",

Among the many types of pemphigus, the rarest clinical variant is pemphigus vegetans. It distinguishes itself from pemphigus vulgaris by the formation of vegetative plaques in intertriginous areas and oral mucosa. Thought to be a subtype of pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus vegetans represents 1-2% of all pemphigus . It is often difficult to diagnose and clinically misleading due to the variable presentation and presence of verrucous vegetations. There are two clinically recognized forms of pemphigus vegetans, the Hallopeau type, and Neumann type. The Hallopeau type has an indolent course and characteristically demonstrates pustules that heal as vegetative plaques. The oral mucosa is frequently uninvolved. The Neumann type is more severe and refractory to treatment, with vegetations that develop during an eruption of vesiculobullous lesions. The oral mucosa is usually involved. The most common cause of pemphigus vegetans is autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and desmoglein 1 (DSG1). The mainstay of treatment for pemphigus vegetans is similar to that of pemphigus vulgaris, consisting of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.",

            "abstract":"Pemphigus is a group of rare, potentially devastating autoimmune diseases of the skin and mucous membranes with high morbidity and potentially lethal outcome. The major clinical variant, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is caused by a loss of intercellular adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes which is induced by IgG autoantibodies against components of desmosomes. Specifically, IgG against the desmosomal adhesion proteins, desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) and desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), preferentially target their ectodomains which are presumably critical for the transinteraction and signalling function of these adhesion molecules. There is a close immunogenetic association of PV with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, HLA-DRB1*04:02 and HLA-DQB1*05:03. These have been shown to be critical for the presentation of immunodominant peptides to autoreactive CD4+ T helper cells. The importance of autoaggressive T-B cell interaction in the induction of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies which directly cause epidermal loss of adhesion has been demonstrated both clinically (by the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab) and experimentally (in PV mouse models). The strong association of clinically active pemphigus with autoantibodies of the IgG4 and IgE subclasses strongly suggests that T helper 2 cells are critical regulators of the immune pathogenesis of pemphigus. Novel therapeutic approaches target autoreactive T and B cells to specifically interfere with the T cell-dependent activation of B cells leading to the generation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells. Our improved understanding of the autoantibody-driven effector phase of pemphigus has led to the introduction of novel therapies that target pathogenic autoantibodies such as immunoadsorption and drugs that block pathogenic autoantibody-induced cell signalling events.",

However, whether these Th2 cytokines act at earlier stages remains unknown. We investigated the roles of cytokines in expression levels of mRNAs and/or proteins in primary mouse keratinocytes and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells at earlier stages. We showed that IL-4 downregulated the expression levels of Krt1, Krt10, Dsg1, and Dsc1 via IL-4R\u03b1- and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT6)-dependent mechanisms in differentiating mouse keratinocytes at early stages. As the expression levels of keratin-1 and -10 in the keratinocytes transiently expressing an active form of STAT6 were not downregulated, STAT6 and other IL-4-induced molecules may synergistically regulate this expression. The restoration of the downregulated expression levels of Krt1 and Krt10 induced by IL-4 with the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor U0126 indicated the involvement of the p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway in the attenuated expression. IL-13 also downregulated the expression of the four genes. Furthermore, IL-4 or IL-13 caused the downregulation of these genes in HaCaT cells and promoted the fragmentation of cell sheets with mechanical stress.

Analysis of intron/exon organization of the Dsg1-alpha and Dsg1-beta genes revealed significant conservation. The full-length mouse Dsg1-beta cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3180 bp encoding a precursor protein of 1060 amino acids. Dsg1-beta protein shares 94% and 76% identity with mouse Dsg1-alpha and human DSG1, respectively. RT-PCR using a multitissue cDNA panel demonstrated that while Dsg1-alpha mRNA was expressed in 15- to 17-day-old embryos and adult spleen and testis, Dsg1-beta mRNA was detected in 17-day-old embryos only. To assess subcellular localization, a FLAG-tagged expression construct of Dsg1-beta was transiently expressed in epithelial HaCaT cells. Dsg1-beta-FLAG was found at the cell-cell border and was recognized by the anti-Dsg1/Dsg2 antibody DG3.10. In summary, we have cloned and characterized a novel member of the mouse desmoglein gene family, Dsg1-beta.",

The hyperkeratosis was initially restricted to the footpads. The footpad lesions caused severe discomfort to the dog and had to be trimmed under anesthesia every 8-10 weeks. Histologically, the epidermis showed papillated villous projections of dense keratin in the stratum corneum. Starting at eight months of age, the patient additionally developed signs consistent with atopic dermatitis and recurrent bacterial skin and ear infections. Crusted hyperkeratotic plaques developed at sites of infection. We sequenced the genome of the affected dog and compared the data to 655 control genomes. A search for variants in 32 candidate genes associated with human palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) revealed a single private protein-changing variant in the affected dog. This was located in the DSG1 gene encoding desmoglein 1. Heterozygous monoallelic DSG1 variants have been reported in human patients with striate palmoplantar keratoderma I (SPPK1), while biallelic DSG1 loss of function variants in humans lead to a more pronounced condition termed severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome. The identified canine variant, DSG1:c.2541_2545delGGGCT, leads to a frameshift and truncates about 20% of the coding sequence. The affected dog was homozygous for the mutant allele. The comparative data on desmoglein 1 function in humans suggest that the identified DSG1 variant may have caused the footpad hyperkeratosis and predisposition for allergies and skin infections in the affected dog.",

The binding of autoantibodies to Dsg proteins induces a separation of neighbouring keratinocytes, in a process known as acantholysis. The two main pemphigus variants are pemphigus vulgaris, which often originates with painful oral erosions, and pemphigus foliaceus, which is characterised by exclusive skin lesions. Pemphigus is diagnosed on the basis of either IgG or complement component 3 deposits (or both) at the keratinocyte cell membrane, detected by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy, with serum anti-Dsg1 or anti-Dsg3 antibodies (or both) detected by ELISA. Corticosteroids are the therapeutic mainstay, which have recently been complemented by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in moderate and severe disease. Rituximab induces complete remission off therapy in 90% of patients, despite rapid tapering of corticosteroids, thus allowing for a major corticosteroid-sparing effect and a halved number of adverse events related to corticosteroids.",

Among the many types of pemphigus, the rarest clinical variant is pemphigus vegetans. It distinguishes itself from pemphigus vulgaris by the formation of vegetative plaques in intertriginous areas and oral mucosa. Thought to be a subtype of pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus vegetans represents 1-2% of all pemphigus . It is often difficult to diagnose and clinically misleading due to the variable presentation and presence of verrucous vegetations. There are two clinically recognized forms of pemphigus vegetans, the Hallopeau type, and Neumann type. The Hallopeau type has an indolent course and characteristically demonstrates pustules that heal as vegetative plaques. The oral mucosa is frequently uninvolved. The Neumann type is more severe and refractory to treatment, with vegetations that develop during an eruption of vesiculobullous lesions. The oral mucosa is usually involved. The most common cause of pemphigus vegetans is autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and desmoglein 1 (DSG1). The mainstay of treatment for pemphigus vegetans is similar to that of pemphigus vulgaris, consisting of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.",

Keratinocytes and melanocytes respond to UV exposure by eliciting a tanning response dependent in part on paracrine signaling, but how keratinocyte:melanocyte communication is regulated during this response remains understudied. Here, we uncover a surprising new function for the keratinocyte-specific cell-cell adhesion molecule desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) in regulating keratinocyte:melanocyte paracrine signaling to promote the tanning response in the absence of UV exposure. Melanocytes within Dsg1-silenced human skin equivalents exhibited increased pigmentation and altered dendrite morphology, phenotypes which were confirmed in 2D culture using conditioned media from Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes. Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone precursor (Pomc) and cytokine mRNA. Melanocytes cultured in media conditioned by Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes increased Mitf and Tyrp1 mRNA, TYRP1 protein, and melanin production and secretion. Melanocytes in Dsg1-silenced skin equivalents mislocalized suprabasally, reminiscent of early melanoma pagetoid behavior. Together with our previous report that UV reduces Dsg1 expression, these data support a role for Dsg1 in controlling keratinocyte:melanocyte paracrine communication and raise the possibility that a Dsg1-deficient niche contributes to pagetoid behavior, such as occurs in early melanoma development.",

            "abstract":"Pemphigus is a group of rare, potentially devastating autoimmune diseases of the skin and mucous membranes with high morbidity and potentially lethal outcome. The major clinical variant, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is caused by a loss of intercellular adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes which is induced by IgG autoantibodies against components of desmosomes. Specifically, IgG against the desmosomal adhesion proteins, desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) and desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), preferentially target their ectodomains which are presumably critical for the transinteraction and signalling function of these adhesion molecules. There is a close immunogenetic association of PV with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, HLA-DRB1*04:02 and HLA-DQB1*05:03. These have been shown to be critical for the presentation of immunodominant peptides to autoreactive CD4+ T helper cells. The importance of autoaggressive T-B cell interaction in the induction of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies which directly cause epidermal loss of adhesion has been demonstrated both clinically (by the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab) and experimentally (in PV mouse models). The strong association of clinically active pemphigus with autoantibodies of the IgG4 and IgE subclasses strongly suggests that T helper 2 cells are critical regulators of the immune pathogenesis of pemphigus. Novel therapeutic approaches target autoreactive T and B cells to specifically interfere with the T cell-dependent activation of B cells leading to the generation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells. Our improved understanding of the autoantibody-driven effector phase of pemphigus has led to the introduction of novel therapies that target pathogenic autoantibodies such as immunoadsorption and drugs that block pathogenic autoantibody-induced cell signalling events.",

However, whether these Th2 cytokines act at earlier stages remains unknown. We investigated the roles of cytokines in expression levels of mRNAs and/or proteins in primary mouse keratinocytes and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells at earlier stages. We showed that IL-4 downregulated the expression levels of Krt1, Krt10, Dsg1, and Dsc1 via IL-4R\u03b1- and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT6)-dependent mechanisms in differentiating mouse keratinocytes at early stages. As the expression levels of keratin-1 and -10 in the keratinocytes transiently expressing an active form of STAT6 were not downregulated, STAT6 and other IL-4-induced molecules may synergistically regulate this expression. The restoration of the downregulated expression levels of Krt1 and Krt10 induced by IL-4 with the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor U0126 indicated the involvement of the p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway in the attenuated expression. IL-13 also downregulated the expression of the four genes. Furthermore, IL-4 or IL-13 caused the downregulation of these genes in HaCaT cells and promoted the fragmentation of cell sheets with mechanical stress.

The binding of autoantibodies to Dsg proteins induces a separation of neighbouring keratinocytes, in a process known as acantholysis. The two main pemphigus variants are pemphigus vulgaris, which often originates with painful oral erosions, and pemphigus foliaceus, which is characterised by exclusive skin lesions. Pemphigus is diagnosed on the basis of either IgG or complement component 3 deposits (or both) at the keratinocyte cell membrane, detected by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy, with serum anti-Dsg1 or anti-Dsg3 antibodies (or both) detected by ELISA. Corticosteroids are the therapeutic mainstay, which have recently been complemented by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in moderate and severe disease. Rituximab induces complete remission off therapy in 90% of patients, despite rapid tapering of corticosteroids, thus allowing for a major corticosteroid-sparing effect and a halved number of adverse events related to corticosteroids.",

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) usually is associated with autoantibodies against Dsg3 whereas pemphigus foliaceus (PF) patients present autoantibodies against Dsg1. Several signaling pathways were proposed to cause loss of keratinocyte adhesion. However, relevance of different signaling pathways and role of Dsg1 and 3 to trigger signaling are not fully understood. Here, we show that Ca2+ chelation reduced PV-IgG- and PF-IgG-mediated loss of HaCaT keratinocyte cohesion whereas EGFR inhibition did not inhibit effects of PF-IgG. PV-IgG activated EGFR in a Src-dependent manner whereas both PV-IgG and PF-IgG caused Ca2+ influx independent of EGFR. ERK activation was Src-dependent in response to PV-IgG but not PF-IgG. To delineate the roles of Dsg isoforms to trigger signaling pathways, Dsg3- and Dsg2-deficient HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9. Dsg3- but not Dsg2-deficient cells were protected against PV-IgG-induced loss of cell adhesion. Ca2+ influx and ERK activation in response to PF-IgG were preserved in both cell lines.",

Among the many types of pemphigus, the rarest clinical variant is pemphigus vegetans. It distinguishes itself from pemphigus vulgaris by the formation of vegetative plaques in intertriginous areas and oral mucosa. Thought to be a subtype of pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus vegetans represents 1-2% of all pemphigus . It is often difficult to diagnose and clinically misleading due to the variable presentation and presence of verrucous vegetations. There are two clinically recognized forms of pemphigus vegetans, the Hallopeau type, and Neumann type. The Hallopeau type has an indolent course and characteristically demonstrates pustules that heal as vegetative plaques. The oral mucosa is frequently uninvolved. The Neumann type is more severe and refractory to treatment, with vegetations that develop during an eruption of vesiculobullous lesions. The oral mucosa is usually involved. The most common cause of pemphigus vegetans is autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and desmoglein 1 (DSG1). The mainstay of treatment for pemphigus vegetans is similar to that of pemphigus vulgaris, consisting of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.",

Keratinocytes and melanocytes respond to UV exposure by eliciting a tanning response dependent in part on paracrine signaling, but how keratinocyte:melanocyte communication is regulated during this response remains understudied. Here, we uncover a surprising new function for the keratinocyte-specific cell-cell adhesion molecule desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) in regulating keratinocyte:melanocyte paracrine signaling to promote the tanning response in the absence of UV exposure. Melanocytes within Dsg1-silenced human skin equivalents exhibited increased pigmentation and altered dendrite morphology, phenotypes which were confirmed in 2D culture using conditioned media from Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes. Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone precursor (Pomc) and cytokine mRNA. Melanocytes cultured in media conditioned by Dsg1-silenced keratinocytes increased Mitf and Tyrp1 mRNA, TYRP1 protein, and melanin production and secretion. Melanocytes in Dsg1-silenced skin equivalents mislocalized suprabasally, reminiscent of early melanoma pagetoid behavior. Together with our previous report that UV reduces Dsg1 expression, these data support a role for Dsg1 in controlling keratinocyte:melanocyte paracrine communication and raise the possibility that a Dsg1-deficient niche contributes to pagetoid behavior, such as occurs in early melanoma development.",

            "abstract":"Desmosomes are major intercellular adhesion junctions that provide stable cell-cell contacts and mechanical strength to epithelial tissues by anchoring cytokeratin intermediate filaments of adjacent cells. Desmogleins (Dsg) are transmembrane core components of the desmosomes, and belong to the cadherin supergene family of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules. Currently, there are three known isoforms of Dsgs (Dsg1, Dsg2, and Dsg3), encoded by distinct genes that are differentially expressed to determine their tissue specificity and differentiation state of epithelial cells. In this study, we cloned a novel mouse desmoglein gene sharing high homology to both mouse and human Dsg1. We propose to designate the previously published mouse Dsg1 gene as Dsg1-alpha and the new gene as Dsg1-beta. Analysis of intron/exon organization of the Dsg1-alpha and Dsg1-beta genes revealed significant conservation. The full-length mouse Dsg1-beta cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3180 bp encoding a precursor protein of 1060 amino acids. Dsg1-beta protein shares 94% and 76% identity with mouse Dsg1-alpha and human DSG1, respectively. RT-PCR using a multitissue cDNA panel demonstrated that while Dsg1-alpha mRNA was expressed in 15- to 17-day-old embryos and adult spleen and testis, Dsg1-beta mRNA was detected in 17-day-old embryos only. To assess subcellular localization, a FLAG-tagged expression construct of Dsg1-beta was transiently expressed in epithelial HaCaT cells. Dsg1-beta-FLAG was found at the cell-cell border and was recognized by the anti-Dsg1/Dsg2 antibody DG3.10. In summary, we have cloned and characterized a novel member of the mouse desmoglein gene family, Dsg1-beta.",
