            "abstract":"Pyruvate is an important intermediate of central carbon metabolism and connects a variety of metabolic pathways in Escherichia coli Although the intracellular pyruvate concentration is dynamically altered and tightly balanced during cell growth, the pyruvate transport system remains unclear. Here, we identified a pyruvate transporter in E. coli using high-throughput transposon sequencing. The transposon mutant library (a total of 5 \u00d7 105 mutants) was serially grown with a toxic pyruvate analog (3-fluoropyruvate [3FP]) to enrich for transposon mutants lacking pyruvate transport function. A total of 52 candidates were selected on the basis of a stringent enrichment level of transposon insertion frequency in response to 3FP treatment. Subsequently, their pyruvate transporter function was examined by conventional functional assays, such as those measuring growth inhibition by the toxic pyruvate analog and pyruvate uptake activity. The pyruvate transporter system comprises CstA and YbdD, which are known as a peptide transporter and a conserved protein, respectively, whose functions are associated with carbon starvation conditions. In addition to the presence of more than one endogenous pyruvate importer, it has been suggested that the E. coli genome encodes constitutive and inducible pyruvate transporters. Our results demonstrated that CstA and YbdD comprise the constitutive pyruvate transporter system in E. coli, which is consistent with the tentative genomic locus previously suggested and the functional relationship with the extracellular pyruvate sensing system. The identification of this pyruvate transporter system provides valuable genetic information for understanding the complex process of pyruvate metabolism in E. coliIMPORTANCE Pyruvate is an important metabolite as a central node in bacterial metabolism, and its intracellular levels are tightly regulated to maintain its functional roles in highly interconnected metabolic pathways. However, an understanding of the mechanism of how bacterial cells excrete and transport pyruvate remains elusive. Using high-throughput transposon sequencing followed by pyruvate uptake activity testing of the selected candidate genes, we found that a pyruvate transporter system comprising CstA and YbdD, currently annotated as a peptide transporter and a conserved protein, respectively, constitutively transports pyruvate. The identification of the physiological role of the pyruvate transporter system provides valuable genetic information for understanding the complex pyruvate metabolism in Escherichia coli.",

            "abstract":"The cst operon of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is under the transcriptional control of CsoR-like sulfurtransferase repressor (CstR). Expression of this operon is induced by hydrogen sulfide, and two components of the cst operon, cstA and cstB, protect S. aureus from sulfide toxicity. CstA is a three-domain protein, and each domain harbors a single cysteine that is proposed to function in vectorial persulfide shuttling. We show here that single cysteine substitution mutants of CstA fail to protect S. aureus against sulfide toxicity in vivo. The N-terminal domain of CstA exhibits thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST; rhodanese) activity, and a Cys66 (34)S-persulfide is formed as a catalytic intermediate in both the presence and absence of the adjacent TusA-like domain using (34)S-SO3(2-) as a substrate. Cysteine persulfides can be trapped on both C66 in CstA(Rhod) and on C66 and C128 in CstA(Rhod-TusA) when incubated with thiosulfate, sodium tetrasulfide (Na2S4), and in situ persulfurated SufS. C66A substitution in CstA(Rhod-TusA) abolishes C128 S-sulfhydration, consistent with directional persulfide shuttling in CstA. Fully reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) is predominately monomeric, and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry reveals that Cys66 and Cys128 can form a C66-C128 disulfide bond using a number of oxidants, which leads to a significant change in conformation. A competing intermolecular C128-C128' disulfide bond is also formed. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements and gel filtration chromatography of reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) reveal an elongated molecule (Rg \u2248 30 \u00c5, 21.6 kDa) where the two domains pack \"side-by-side\" that likely places Cys66 and Cys128 far apart. These studies are consistent with the low yield of C66-C128 cross-link as a mimic of a persulfide transfer intermediate in CstA, and small, but measurable persulfide transfer from Cys66 to Cys128 within the CstA(Rhod-TusA) with inorganic sulfur donors.",

            "abstract":"Improved insight into the molecular mechanisms of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is required to predict prognosis and develop a new therapeutic strategy for targeted genes. The aim of this study is to identify significant genes associated with HNSCC and to further analyze its prognostic significance. In our study, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) HNSCC database and the gene expression profiles of GSE6631 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to explore the differential co-expression genes in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. A total of 29 differential co-expression genes were screened out by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analysis methods. As suggested in functional annotation analysis using the R clusterProfiler package, these genes were mainly enriched in epidermis development and differentiation (biological process), apical plasma membrane and cell-cell junction (cellular component), and enzyme inhibitor activity (molecular function). Furthermore, in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 21 nodes and 25 edges, the ten hub genes (S100A8, S100A9, IL1RN, CSTA, ANXA1, KRT4, TGM3, SCEL, PPL, and PSCA) were identified using the CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. The expression of the ten hub genes were all downregulated in HNSCC tissues compared with normal tissues. Based on survival analysis, the lower expression of CSTA was associated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with HNSCC. Finally, the protein level of CSTA, which was validated by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, was down-regulated consistently with mRNA levels in head and neck cancer samples. In summary, our study demonstrated that a survival-related gene is highly correlated with head and neck cancer development. Thus, CSTA may play important roles in the progression of head and neck cancer and serve as a potential biomarker for future diagnosis and treatment.",

However, little is known about the significance of CSTA expression in ESCC.The mRNA expression of CSTA was evaluated by qRT-PCR using 28 paired frozen samples of tumor and nontumor mucosae. The protein expression of CSTA was evaluated by the immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of ESCC samples from 59 patients who underwent surgery, and its relationship with clinical features was analyzed.The mRNA expression of CSTA was significantly decreased in ESCC compared with that in matched normal mucosa (P < .0001). The protein expression of CSTA was limited in stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum but not in stratum basal in normal esophageal mucosa. It was reduced in all ESCC tissue samples compared with normal tissues; however, CSTA expression levels in tumors showed considerable variation. Of the 59 samples, 20 did not express CSTA, whereas 39 clearly expressed it. The expression of CSTA in tumors was significantly associated with pT classification (deeper tumor invasions) (P = .0118) and advanced TNM stages (P = .0497). In CSTA-positive tumor samples, CSTA-expressing cancer cells often expressed Ki67, a proliferation marker, which was in sharp contrast to normal mucosa, where Ki67-expressing cells were limited to the basal layer and did not express CSTA. Furthermore, CSTA expression was observed in all 22 lymph node metastases analyzed.Relatively high levels of CSTA expression in tumors were correlated with tumor progression and advanced cancer stage, including lymph node metastasis.",

The upstream CsrA binding site (GCACACGGAU) was used to search the Escherichia coli genomic sequence for other genes that might be regulated by CsrA. cstA contained an exact match that overlapped its Shine-Dalgarno sequence. cstA was previously shown to be induced by carbon starvation and to encode a peptide transporter. Expression of a cstA'-'lacZ translational fusion in wild-type and csrA mutant strains was examined. Expression levels in the csrA mutant were approximately twofold higher when cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) and 5- to 10-fold higher when LB was supplemented with glucose. It was previously shown that cstA is regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex and transcribed by Esigma(70). We investigated the influence of sigma(S) on cstA expression and found that a sigma(S) deficiency resulted in a threefold increase in cstA expression in wild-type and csrA mutant strains; however, CsrA-dependent regulation was retained. The mechanism of CsrA-mediated cstA regulation was also examined in vitro. Cross-linking studies demonstrated that CsrA is a homodimer. Gel mobility shift results showed that CsrA binds specifically to cstA RNA, while coupled-transcription-translation and toeprint studies demonstrated that CsrA regulates CstA synthesis by inhibiting ribosome binding to cstA transcripts. RNA footprint and boundary analyses revealed three or four CsrA binding sites, one of which overlaps the cstA Shine-Dalgarno sequence, as predicted. These results establish that CsrA regulates translation of cstA by sterically interfering with ribosome binding.",

CSTA acts as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer, however, its role in lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here we found that CSTA was down-regulated in all lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung epithelial cells. CSTA was restored in most lung cancer cell lines after treatment with demethylation agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and deacetylation agent Trichostatin. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that CSTA was partially methylated in the promoter and exon 1. In primary lung tumors, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) significantly expressed more CSTA compared to adenocarcinoma (p<0.00001), and higher expression of CSTA was significantly associated with lower tumor grade (p<0.01). CSTA stable transfection reduced the activity of cathepsin B and inhibited the ability of colony formation, migration and invasion, and enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. CSTA overexpression resulted in reduced activity of ERK, p-38, and AKT. Additionally, CSTA overexpression led to a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and prevented the TGF-\u03b21-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through inhibiting the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, our date indicate 1) epigenetic regulation is associated with CSTA gene silencing; 2) CSTA exerts tumor suppressive function through inhibiting MAPK and AKT pathways; 3) Overexpression of CSTA leads to MET and prevents TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT by modulating the MAPK pathway; 4) CSTA may be a potential biomarker for lung SCC and tumor differentiation.",

This screening led to the identification of CstA, a conserved protein that specifically interacts with Sec24A, a component of the ERES. We found that a tagged CstA is secreted in Brucella abortus culture medium. This secretion is independent of the type IV secretion system VirB and the flagellum, suggesting that CstA is secreted through another system. We also discovered that a B. abortus cstA mutant is impaired for its association with the Sec23 ERES marker. The B. abortus cstA mutant displayed peculiar trafficking, with reduced association with LAMP1 and Calnexin 12 h post-infection in HeLa cells.

Our results demonstrated that CstA and YbdD comprise the constitutive pyruvate transporter system in E. coli, which is consistent with the tentative genomic locus previously suggested and the functional relationship with the extracellular pyruvate sensing system. The identification of this pyruvate transporter system provides valuable genetic information for understanding the complex process of pyruvate metabolism in E. coliIMPORTANCE Pyruvate is an important metabolite as a central node in bacterial metabolism, and its intracellular levels are tightly regulated to maintain its functional roles in highly interconnected metabolic pathways. However, an understanding of the mechanism of how bacterial cells excrete and transport pyruvate remains elusive. Using high-throughput transposon sequencing followed by pyruvate uptake activity testing of the selected candidate genes, we found that a pyruvate transporter system comprising CstA and YbdD, currently annotated as a peptide transporter and a conserved protein, respectively, constitutively transports pyruvate. The identification of the physiological role of the pyruvate transporter system provides valuable genetic information for understanding the complex pyruvate metabolism in Escherichia coli.",

            "abstract":"The cst operon of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is under the transcriptional control of CsoR-like sulfurtransferase repressor (CstR). Expression of this operon is induced by hydrogen sulfide, and two components of the cst operon, cstA and cstB, protect S. aureus from sulfide toxicity. CstA is a three-domain protein, and each domain harbors a single cysteine that is proposed to function in vectorial persulfide shuttling. We show here that single cysteine substitution mutants of CstA fail to protect S. aureus against sulfide toxicity in vivo. The N-terminal domain of CstA exhibits thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST; rhodanese) activity, and a Cys66 (34)S-persulfide is formed as a catalytic intermediate in both the presence and absence of the adjacent TusA-like domain using (34)S-SO3(2-) as a substrate. Cysteine persulfides can be trapped on both C66 in CstA(Rhod) and on C66 and C128 in CstA(Rhod-TusA) when incubated with thiosulfate, sodium tetrasulfide (Na2S4), and in situ persulfurated SufS. C66A substitution in CstA(Rhod-TusA) abolishes C128 S-sulfhydration, consistent with directional persulfide shuttling in CstA. Fully reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) is predominately monomeric, and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry reveals that Cys66 and Cys128 can form a C66-C128 disulfide bond using a number of oxidants, which leads to a significant change in conformation. A competing intermolecular C128-C128' disulfide bond is also formed. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements and gel filtration chromatography of reduced CstA(Rhod-TusA) reveal an elongated molecule (Rg \u2248 30 \u00c5, 21.6 kDa) where the two domains pack \"side-by-side\" that likely places Cys66 and Cys128 far apart. These studies are consistent with the low yield of C66-C128 cross-link as a mimic of a persulfide transfer intermediate in CstA, and small, but measurable persulfide transfer from Cys66 to Cys128 within the CstA(Rhod-TusA) with inorganic sulfur donors.",

The aim of this study is to identify significant genes associated with HNSCC and to further analyze its prognostic significance. In our study, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) HNSCC database and the gene expression profiles of GSE6631 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to explore the differential co-expression genes in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. A total of 29 differential co-expression genes were screened out by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analysis methods. As suggested in functional annotation analysis using the R clusterProfiler package, these genes were mainly enriched in epidermis development and differentiation (biological process), apical plasma membrane and cell-cell junction (cellular component), and enzyme inhibitor activity (molecular function). Furthermore, in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 21 nodes and 25 edges, the ten hub genes (S100A8, S100A9, IL1RN, CSTA, ANXA1, KRT4, TGM3, SCEL, PPL, and PSCA) were identified using the CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. The expression of the ten hub genes were all downregulated in HNSCC tissues compared with normal tissues. Based on survival analysis, the lower expression of CSTA was associated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with HNSCC. Finally, the protein level of CSTA, which was validated by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, was down-regulated consistently with mRNA levels in head and neck cancer samples. In summary, our study demonstrated that a survival-related gene is highly correlated with head and neck cancer development. Thus, CSTA may play important roles in the progression of head and neck cancer and serve as a potential biomarker for future diagnosis and treatment.",

However, little is known about the significance of CSTA expression in ESCC.The mRNA expression of CSTA was evaluated by qRT-PCR using 28 paired frozen samples of tumor and nontumor mucosae. The protein expression of CSTA was evaluated by the immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of ESCC samples from 59 patients who underwent surgery, and its relationship with clinical features was analyzed.The mRNA expression of CSTA was significantly decreased in ESCC compared with that in matched normal mucosa (P < .0001). The protein expression of CSTA was limited in stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum but not in stratum basal in normal esophageal mucosa. It was reduced in all ESCC tissue samples compared with normal tissues; however, CSTA expression levels in tumors showed considerable variation. Of the 59 samples, 20 did not express CSTA, whereas 39 clearly expressed it. The expression of CSTA in tumors was significantly associated with pT classification (deeper tumor invasions) (P = .0118) and advanced TNM stages (P = .0497). In CSTA-positive tumor samples, CSTA-expressing cancer cells often expressed Ki67, a proliferation marker, which was in sharp contrast to normal mucosa, where Ki67-expressing cells were limited to the basal layer and did not express CSTA. Furthermore, CSTA expression was observed in all 22 lymph node metastases analyzed.Relatively high levels of CSTA expression in tumors were correlated with tumor progression and advanced cancer stage, including lymph node metastasis.",

The upstream CsrA binding site (GCACACGGAU) was used to search the Escherichia coli genomic sequence for other genes that might be regulated by CsrA. cstA contained an exact match that overlapped its Shine-Dalgarno sequence. cstA was previously shown to be induced by carbon starvation and to encode a peptide transporter. Expression of a cstA'-'lacZ translational fusion in wild-type and csrA mutant strains was examined. Expression levels in the csrA mutant were approximately twofold higher when cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) and 5- to 10-fold higher when LB was supplemented with glucose. It was previously shown that cstA is regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex and transcribed by Esigma(70). We investigated the influence of sigma(S) on cstA expression and found that a sigma(S) deficiency resulted in a threefold increase in cstA expression in wild-type and csrA mutant strains; however, CsrA-dependent regulation was retained. The mechanism of CsrA-mediated cstA regulation was also examined in vitro. Cross-linking studies demonstrated that CsrA is a homodimer. Gel mobility shift results showed that CsrA binds specifically to cstA RNA, while coupled-transcription-translation and toeprint studies demonstrated that CsrA regulates CstA synthesis by inhibiting ribosome binding to cstA transcripts. RNA footprint and boundary analyses revealed three or four CsrA binding sites, one of which overlaps the cstA Shine-Dalgarno sequence, as predicted.

CSTA acts as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer, however, its role in lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here we found that CSTA was down-regulated in all lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung epithelial cells. CSTA was restored in most lung cancer cell lines after treatment with demethylation agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and deacetylation agent Trichostatin. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that CSTA was partially methylated in the promoter and exon 1. In primary lung tumors, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) significantly expressed more CSTA compared to adenocarcinoma (p<0.00001), and higher expression of CSTA was significantly associated with lower tumor grade (p<0.01). CSTA stable transfection reduced the activity of cathepsin B and inhibited the ability of colony formation, migration and invasion, and enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. CSTA overexpression resulted in reduced activity of ERK, p-38, and AKT. Additionally, CSTA overexpression led to a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and prevented the TGF-\u03b21-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through inhibiting the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, our date indicate 1) epigenetic regulation is associated with CSTA gene silencing; 2) CSTA exerts tumor suppressive function through inhibiting MAPK and AKT pathways; 3) Overexpression of CSTA leads to MET and prevents TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT by modulating the MAPK pathway; 4) CSTA may be a potential biomarker for lung SCC and tumor differentiation.",

This screening led to the identification of CstA, a conserved protein that specifically interacts with Sec24A, a component of the ERES. We found that a tagged CstA is secreted in Brucella abortus culture medium. This secretion is independent of the type IV secretion system VirB and the flagellum, suggesting that CstA is secreted through another system. We also discovered that a B. abortus cstA mutant is impaired for its association with the Sec23 ERES marker. The B. abortus cstA mutant displayed peculiar trafficking, with reduced association with LAMP1 and Calnexin 12 h post-infection in HeLa cells.

However, unlike resistance, which is commonly measured using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) metric, tolerance is poorly characterized, owing to the lack of a similar quantitative indicator. This may lead to the misclassification of tolerant strains as resistant, or vice versa, and result in ineffective treatments. In this Opinion article, we describe recent studies of tolerance, resistance and persistence, outlining how a clear and distinct definition for each phenotype can be developed from these findings. We propose a framework for classifying the drug response of bacterial strains according to these definitions that is based on the measurement of the MIC together with a recently defined quantitative indicator of tolerance, the minimum duration for killing (MDK). Finally, we discuss genes that are associated with increased tolerance - the 'tolerome' - as targets for treating tolerant bacterial strains.",

The deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), which is the last enzyme in the pathway of tyrosine catabolism, results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the FAH-deficient hepatocytes and proximal renal tubular cells, and subsequently leads to liver and kidney damage. HT-1 typically manifests in infancy and is characterized by elevated plasma tyrosine levels. For children whose HT-1 is not detected by the newborn screening, liver dysfunction, such as bleeding abnormalities, hypoglycemia, ascites, edema, vomiting, irritability, and jaundice, is the dominant clinical manifestation. Progression of the liver disease can be chronic or acute, with rapid deterioration. The lifetime risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is as high as 37% in the survivors without treatment, according to previous research. Many patients also suffer from neurocognitive deficits. If untreated, survival in patients with HT-1 is less than 12 months of life; most of these children die as a result of liver failure and severe coagulopathy. The prevalence of HT-1 ranges from one in 12,000 to one in 100,000 individuals of Northern European descent. In Canada, higher prevalence (one in 1,846 live births) was observed in the Saguenay\u2013Lac Saint-Jean region in Quebec.",

Here we identify midkine (MDK) as a melanoma-secreted driver of an inflamed, but immune evasive, microenvironment that defines poor patient prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Mechanistically, MDK was found to control the transcriptome of melanoma cells, allowing for coordinated activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB and downregulation of interferon-associated pathways. The resulting MDK-modulated secretome educated macrophages towards tolerant phenotypes that promoted CD8+ T cell dysfunction. In contrast, genetic targeting of MDK sensitized melanoma cells to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 treatment. Emphasizing the translational relevance of these findings, the expression profile of MDK-depleted tumors was enriched in key indicators of a good response to immune checkpoint blockers in independent patient cohorts. Together, these data reveal that MDK acts as an internal modulator of autocrine and paracrine signals that maintain immune suppression in aggressive melanomas.",

We performed gene expression profiling of microdissected breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma samples and compared their transcriptional profiles with those previously obtained from normal T-cells and other peripheral T-cell lymphomas and validated expression of selected markers by immunohistochemistry. Our results indicate that most breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphomas exhibit an activated CD4+ memory T-cell phenotype, which is associated with CD25 and FoxP3 expression. Gene ontology analyses revealed upregulation of genes involved in cell motility programs (e.g., CCR6, MET, HGF, CXCL14) in breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphomas compared to normal CD4+ T-cells and upregulation of genes involved in myeloid cell differentiation (e.g., PPARg, JAK2, SPI-1, GAB2) and viral gene transcription (e.g., RPS10, RPL17, RPS29, RPL18A) compared to other types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Gene set enrichment analyses also revealed shared features between the molecular profiles of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphomas and other types of anaplastic large cell lymphomas, including downregulation of T-cell receptor signaling and STAT3 activation.

Synergistically acting second genes must cooperate. Here, we constructed doxycycline-inducible cDNA-libraries from pre-B cell mRNA. These libraries were retrovirally transduced as single copies into single cells and overexpressed in fetal-liver-derived c-myc-overexpressing pre-B cell lines. We scored transformation by survival and/or expansion of differentiating B-lineage cells in vitro and in vivo. Only one double c-myc/cDNA-library-expressing cell line was found in less than 5 \u00d7 106 library-transduced pre-B cells surviving and expressing a cDNA-library-derived transcript in vitro. This transcript was identified as a shortened form of the Exosc1 gene, encoding the RNA exosome complex component CSL4. Transplantations of double c-myc/Exosc1 short-form- or c-myc/Exosc1 full-length-transgenic cells into Rag1-/- mice resulted in survival, differentiation to CD19+ CD93- sIgM+ CD5low/- CD11b+ mature B1 cells and, surprisingly, also vigorous expansion in vivo. Strikingly, after transplantations of c-myc/cDNA-library pre-BI cells the frequencies of double-transgenic pre-B cells and their differentiated progeny, expanding in vivo to heterogeneous phenotypes, was at least tenfold higher than in vitro. In a first analysis Ptprcap, Cacybp, Ndufs7, Rpl18a, and Rpl35a were identified. This suggests a strong influence of the host on B-cell transformation.",

Currently, there is no widely accepted treatment for mesothelioma. Development of effective drug treatments for human cancers requires identification of therapeutic molecular targets. We therefore conducted a large-scale functional screening of mesothelioma cells using a genome-wide small interfering RNA library. We determined that knockdown of 39 genes suppressed mesothelioma cell proliferation. At least seven of the 39 genes-COPA, COPB2, EIF3D, POLR2A, PSMA6, RBM8A, and RPL18A-would be involved in anti-apoptotic function. In particular, the COPA protein was highly expressed in some mesothelioma cell lines but not in a pleural mesothelial cell line. COPA knockdown induced apoptosis and suppressed tumor growth in a mesothelioma mouse model. Therefore, COPA may have the potential of a therapeutic target and a new diagnostic marker of mesothelioma.",

Medical problems commonly caused by terminal deletions of 1p36 include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, vision problems, hearing loss, short stature, distinctive facial features, brain anomalies, orofacial clefting, congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, and renal anomalies. Although 1p36 deletion syndrome is considered clinically recognizable, there is significant phenotypic variation among affected individuals. This variation is due, at least in part, to the genetic heterogeneity seen in 1p36 deletions which include terminal and interstitial deletions of varying lengths located throughout the 30 Mb of DNA that comprise chromosome 1p36. Array-based copy number variant analysis can easily identify genomic regions of 1p36 that are deleted in an affected individual. However, predicting the phenotype of an individual based solely on the location and extent of their 1p36 deletion remains a challenge since most of the genes that contribute to 1p36-related phenotypes have yet to be identified. In addition, haploinsufficiency of more than one gene may contribute to some phenotypes. In this article, we review recent successes in the effort to map and identify the genes and genomic regions that contribute to specific 1p36-related phenotypes.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFR\u03b2 up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan (Hspg2)-deficient (Hspg2 - / - -TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas Hspg2 - / - -TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2, SHP-2, and FAK partially through integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFR\u03b2 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.",

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. Methods: We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. Results: By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, HSPG2 and APLNR, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. Conclusion: ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC injury in SSc.",

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFR\u03b2 up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan (Hspg2)-deficient (Hspg2 - / - -TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas Hspg2 - / - -TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2, SHP-2, and FAK partially through integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFR\u03b2 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.",

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. Methods: We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. Results: By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, HSPG2 and APLNR, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. Conclusion: ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC injury in SSc.",

SJS results from mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which encodes perlecan, a major component of basement membranes. Only eight HSPG2 mutations have been reported in six SJS families. Here, we describe the molecular findings in 23 families (35 patients) with SJS, being one-third of the SJS cases reported in the medical literature. We identified 22 new HSPG2 mutations and unreported polymorphisms. Mutations included nine deletion or insertion (41%), six splice site (27%), five missense (23%), and two nonsense mutations (9%). All but four mutations were private, and we found no evidence for a founder effect. Analyses of HSPG2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and perlecan immunostaining on patients' cells revealed a hypomorphic effect of the studied mutations. They also demonstrated distinct consequences of truncating and missense mutations on perlecan expression as truncating mutations resulted in instability of HSPG2 mRNA through nonsense mRNA-mediated decay, whereas missense mutations involving cysteine residues led to intracellular retention of perlecan, probably due to quality control pathways. Our analyses strengthen the idea that SJS results from hypomorphic mutations of the HSPG2 gene. They also propose tools for its molecular diagnosis and provide new clues for the understanding of its pathophysiology.",

After 60 years of research, its cause remains the major unanswered question. Etiology assumes polygenic susceptibility to the disease in interaction with multiple environmental factors. Chronic intoxication with Aristolochia is the major environmental risk factor for this disease. The mycotoxin hypothesis considers that BN is produced by ochratoxin A. The Pliocene lignite hypothesis assumes that the disease is caused by long-term exposure to organic toxins leached from coal nearby the endemic villages. Exome sequencing of 22,000 genes revealed that mutant genes (CELA1, HSPG2, and KCNK5) in BN patients encode proteins involved in basement membrane/extracellular matrix and vascular tone, which are tightly connected to the process of angiogenesis. SEC61G, IL17RA, and HDAC11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs. The acetylation of histone lysine residues was detected and found increased at specific sites of H3 and total H4 histones isolated from urothelial cells of patients with BN. The results of molecular biological research will allow the discovery of genetic markers of BN and associated urothelial cancer, permitting early detection of BN-predisposing mutations and identification of susceptible individuals who might be at risk of exposure to environmental agents. The research of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions could lead to further studies to determine the precise risk for BN.",

Changes in serum proteins in FTD and ALS are poorly understood, and currently no definitive biomarkers exist for diagnosing or monitoring disease progression for either disease. Here we applied quantitative discovery proteomics to analyze protein changes in FTD (N = 72) and ALS (N = 28) patient serum compared to controls (N = 22). Twenty three proteins were significantly altered in FTD compared to controls (increased-APOL1, C3, CTSH, EIF5A, MYH2, S100A8, SUSD5, WDR1; decreased-C1S, C7, CILP2, COMP, CRTAC1, EFEMP1, FBLN1, GSN, HSPG2, IGHV1, ITIH2, PROS1, SHBG, UMOD, VASN) and 14 proteins were significantly altered in ALS compared to controls (increased-APOL1, CKM, CTSH, IGHG1, IGKC, MYH2; decreased-C7, COMP, CRTAC1, EFEMP1, FBLN1, GSN, HSPG2, SHBG). There was substantial overlap in the proteins that were altered in FTD and ALS. These results were validated using western blotting. Gene ontology tools were used to assess functional pathways potentially dysregulated in the two diseases, and calcium ion binding and innate immunity pathways were altered in both diseases. When put together, these results suggest significant overlap in pathophysiological peripheral changes in FTD and ALS. This study represents the first proteomics side-by-side comparison of serum changes in FTD and ALS, providing new insights into under-recognized perturbed pathways and an avenue for biomarker development for FTD and ALS.",

Exon deletion does not alter the expression or the reading frame but causes loss of attachment sites for three heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice are viable and fertile but have small eyes. Apoptosis and leakage of cellular material through the lens capsule are observed in neonatal lenses, and lenses degenerate within 3 weeks of birth. Electron microscopy revealed altered structure of the lens capsule through which cells had formed extensions. No kidney malfunction, such as protein uria, was detected in Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mutant mice, nor were ultrastructural changes observed in the glomerular basement membranes (BMs). To achieve further depletion in the HS content of the BMs, Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice were bred with collagen XVIII null mice. Lens defects were more severe in the newborn Col18a1(-/-) x Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice and degeneration proceeded faster than in Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice. The results suggest that in the lens capsule, HS chains have a structural function and are essential in the insulation of the lens from its environment and in regulation of incoming signals.",

Medical problems commonly caused by terminal deletions of 1p36 include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, vision problems, hearing loss, short stature, distinctive facial features, brain anomalies, orofacial clefting, congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, and renal anomalies. Although 1p36 deletion syndrome is considered clinically recognizable, there is significant phenotypic variation among affected individuals.

Array-based copy number variant analysis can easily identify genomic regions of 1p36 that are deleted in an affected individual. However, predicting the phenotype of an individual based solely on the location and extent of their 1p36 deletion remains a challenge since most of the genes that contribute to 1p36-related phenotypes have yet to be identified. In addition, haploinsufficiency of more than one gene may contribute to some phenotypes. In this article, we review recent successes in the effort to map and identify the genes and genomic regions that contribute to specific 1p36-related phenotypes.

The etiology of mandibular prognathism is still uncertain, with various genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors possibly involved. However, many reports on its coexistence in both twins and segregation in families suggest the importance of genetic influences. A multifactorial and polygenic background with a threshold for expression or an autosomal dominant mode with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are the most probable inheritance patterns. Linkage analyses have, thus far, shown the statistical significance of such loci as 1p22.1, 1p22.3, 1p32.2, 1p36, 3q26.2, 4p16.1, 6q25, 11q22, 12pter-p12.3, 12q13.13, 12q23, 12q24.11, 14q24.3 to 31.2, and 19p13.2.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFR\u03b2 up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan (Hspg2)-deficient (Hspg2 - / - -TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas Hspg2 - / - -TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2, SHP-2, and FAK partially through integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFR\u03b2 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.",

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. Methods: We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. Results: By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, HSPG2 and APLNR, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. Conclusion: ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC injury in SSc.",

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFR\u03b2 up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions.

At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin).

            "abstract":"Objective: The mechanisms that lead to endothelial cell (EC) injury and propagate the vasculopathy in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) are not well understood. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. Methods: We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. Results: By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, HSPG2 and APLNR, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. Conclusion: ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC injury in SSc.",

            "abstract":"Deletions of chromosome 1p36 affect approximately 1 in 5,000 newborns and are the most common terminal deletions in humans. Medical problems commonly caused by terminal deletions of 1p36 include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, vision problems, hearing loss, short stature, distinctive facial features, brain anomalies, orofacial clefting, congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, and renal anomalies. Although 1p36 deletion syndrome is considered clinically recognizable, there is significant phenotypic variation among affected individuals. This variation is due, at least in part, to the genetic heterogeneity seen in 1p36 deletions which include terminal and interstitial deletions of varying lengths located throughout the 30 Mb of DNA that comprise chromosome 1p36. Array-based copy number variant analysis can easily identify genomic regions of 1p36 that are deleted in an affected individual. However, predicting the phenotype of an individual based solely on the location and extent of their 1p36 deletion remains a challenge since most of the genes that contribute to 1p36-related phenotypes have yet to be identified. In addition, haploinsufficiency of more than one gene may contribute to some phenotypes. In this article, we review recent successes in the effort to map and identify the genes and genomic regions that contribute to specific 1p36-related phenotypes. In particular, we highlight evidence implicating MMP23B, GABRD, SKI, PRDM16, KCNAB2, RERE, UBE4B, CASZ1, PDPN, SPEN, ECE1, HSPG2, and LUZP1 in various 1p36 deletion phenotypes.",

The gene is widely expressed throughout the musculoskeletal system including cartilage, bone marrow and skeletal muscle. The HSPG2 gene product, perlecan is a multifunctional proteoglycan that preserves the integrity of extracellular matrices, patrols tissue borders, and controls various signaling pathways affecting cellular phenotype. Given HSPG2's expression pattern and its role in so many fundamental processes, it is not surprising that relatively few gene mutations have been identified in viable organisms. Mutations to the perlecan gene are rare, with effects ranging from a relatively mild condition to a more severe and perinatally lethal form. This review will summarize the important studies characterizing mutations and variants of HSPG2 and discuss how these genomic modifications affect expression, function and phenotype. Additionally, this review will describe the clinical findings of reported HSPG2 mutations and their observed phenotypes. Finally, the evolutionary aspects that link gene integrity to function are discussed, including key findings from both in vivo animal studies and in vitro systems. We also hope to facilitate discussion about perlecan/HSPG2 and its role in normal physiology, to explain how mutation can lead to pathology, and to point out how this information can suggest pathways for future mechanistic studies.",

Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. Methods: We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. Results: By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, HSPG2 and APLNR, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. Conclusion: ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis.

Medical problems commonly caused by terminal deletions of 1p36 include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, vision problems, hearing loss, short stature, distinctive facial features, brain anomalies, orofacial clefting, congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, and renal anomalies. Although 1p36 deletion syndrome is considered clinically recognizable, there is significant phenotypic variation among affected individuals. This variation is due, at least in part, to the genetic heterogeneity seen in 1p36 deletions which include terminal and interstitial deletions of varying lengths located throughout the 30 Mb of DNA that comprise chromosome 1p36. Array-based copy number variant analysis can easily identify genomic regions of 1p36 that are deleted in an affected individual. However, predicting the phenotype of an individual based solely on the location and extent of their 1p36 deletion remains a challenge since most of the genes that contribute to 1p36-related phenotypes have yet to be identified. In addition, haploinsufficiency of more than one gene may contribute to some phenotypes. In this article, we review recent successes in the effort to map and identify the genes and genomic regions that contribute to specific 1p36-related phenotypes. In particular, we highlight evidence implicating MMP23B, GABRD, SKI, PRDM16, KCNAB2, RERE, UBE4B, CASZ1, PDPN, SPEN, ECE1, HSPG2, and LUZP1 in various 1p36 deletion phenotypes.",

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFR\u03b2 up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan (Hspg2)-deficient (Hspg2 - / - -TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas Hspg2 - / - -TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2, SHP-2, and FAK partially through integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFR\u03b2 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.",

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

Linkage analyses have, thus far, shown the statistical significance of such loci as 1p22.1, 1p22.3, 1p32.2, 1p36, 3q26.2, 4p16.1, 6q25, 11q22, 12pter-p12.3, 12q13.13, 12q23, 12q24.11, 14q24.3 to 31.2, and 19p13.2. The following appear among candidate genes: MATN1, EPB41, growth hormone receptor, COL2A1, COL1A1, MYO1H, DUSP6, ARHGAP21, ADAMTS1, FGF23, FGFR2, TBX5, ALPL, HSPG2, EVC, EVC2, the HoxC gene cluster, insulin-like growth factor 1, PLXNA2, SSX2IP, TGFB3, LTBP2, MMP13/CLG3, KRT7, and FBN3. On the other hand, MYH1, MYH2, MYH3, MYH7, MYH8, FOXO3, NFATC1, PTGS2, KAT6B, HDAC4, and RUNX2 expression is suspected to be involved in the epigenetic regulations behind the mandibular prognathism phenotype.",

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFR\u03b2 up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan (Hspg2)-deficient (Hspg2 - / - -TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas Hspg2 - / - -TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2, SHP-2, and FAK partially through integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFR\u03b2 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.",

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. Methods: We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. Results: By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, HSPG2 and APLNR, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. Conclusion: ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC injury in SSc.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ablation of perlecan HS/CS on murine intervertebral disc development. Genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding HS biosynthetic enzymes have identified multiple roles for HS in tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we utilised an Hspg2 exon 3 null HS/CS-deficient mouse to assess the role of perlecan HS in disc cell regulation. HS makes many important contributions to growth factor sequestration, stabilisation/delivery, and activation of receptors directing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and assembly of extracellular matrix. Perlecan HS/CS-mediated interactions promote extracellular matrix assembly/stabilisation and tissue functional properties, and thus, removal of perlecan HS/CS should affect extracellular matrix function and homeostasis. Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs accumulated significantly greater glycosaminoglycan in the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and vertebral growth plates than C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) I intervertebral discs. Proliferation of intervertebral disc progenitor cells was significantly higher in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and these cells became hypertrophic by 12 weeks of age and were prominent in the vertebral growth plates but had a disorganised organisation. C57BL/6 WT vertebral growth plates contained regular columnar growth plate chondrocytes. Exostosis-like, ectopic bone formation occurred in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and differences were evident in disc cell maturation and in matrix deposition in this genotype, indicating that perlecan HS/CS chains had cell and matrix interactive properties which repressively maintained tissue homeostasis in the adult intervertebral disc.",

Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E).

Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes.

Perlecan has important cell regulatory and matrix organizational properties through HS mediated interactions with a range of growth factors and morphogens and with structural extracellular matrix glycoproteins which define tissue function and allow the resident cells to regulate tissue homeostasis. It was expected that ablation of the HS chains on perlecan would severely disrupt normal tendon organization and functional properties and it was envisaged that this study would better define the role of HS in normal tendon function and in tendon repair processes. Tail and Achilles tendons from each genotype were biomechanically tested (ultimate tensile stress (UTS), tensile modulus (TM)) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) compositional analyses were undertaken. Tenocytes were isolated from tail tendons from each mouse genotype and grown in monolayer culture. These cultures were undertaken in the presence of FGF-2 to assess the cell signaling properties of each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from 3-12 week old tail and Achilles tendons and qRT-PCR was undertaken to assess the expression of the following genes Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1. Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FGF-2 stimulated tenocyte monolayers displayed elevated Adamts4, Mmp2, 3, 13 mRNA levels compared to WT mice. Non-stimulated tendon Col1A1, Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1 mRNA levels showed no major differences between the two genotypes other than a decline with ageing while LTBP2 expression increased. Eln expression also declined to a greater extent in the perlecan exon 3 null mice (P < 0.05). Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This indicated a more compact form of collagen localization in the perlecan exon 3 null mice. Collagen fibrils were also smaller by TEM, which may facilitate a more condensed fibril packing accounting for the superior UTS displayed by the perlecan exon 3 null mice. The amplified catabolic phenotype of Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - mice may account for the age-dependent decline in GAG observed in tail tendon over 3 to 12 weeks. After Achilles tenotomy Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - and WT mice had similar rates of recovery of UTS and TM over 12 weeks post operatively indicating that a deficiency of HS was not detrimental to tendon repair.",

This study examined HS content and distribution in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues in the context of potential molecular mechanisms underlying its deregulation in brain tumours. Totally, 42 tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tissues for 31 patients with different prognosis were investigated. HS expression was demonstrated in 50-55% of the GBM tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while almost no HS content was detected in the surrounding paratumourous brain tissues. Heterogeneous HS distribution in the HS-positive tumours was more related to the necrosis or glandular-like brain zones rather than glioma cells with high or low Ki-67 index. According the Kaplan-Meier curves, HS accumulation in glioma cells was associated with low relapse-free survival (RS) of the GBM patients (p < 0.05) and was likely to be due to the increased transcriptional activity of HSPG core proteins (syndecan-1, 2-3 fold; glypican-1, 2,5 fold; perlecan/HSPG2, 13-14 fold). Activation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression correlated with the patients' survival according Kaplan-Meier (p = 0.0243) and Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR = 3.1; P(Y) = 0.03) analyses, while up-regulation of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 was not associated with the patients survival. Taken together, the results indicate that increase of HS content and up-regulation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression in glioblastoma tissues contribute to tumour development through the transformation of brain extracellular matrix into tumour microenvironment, and represent negative prognostic factors for glioblastoma progression.",

            "abstract":"A tissue engineering approach can provide replacement salivary gland structures to patients with hyposalivation disorders and xerostomia. Salivary human stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) were isolated from healthy regions of parotid glands of head and neck surgery patients, expanded, then encapsulated in biocompatible hyaluronate (HA)-based hydrogels. These bioactive hydrogels provide a surrogate territorial matrix suitable for the dynamic assembly, growth and reorganization of salivary gland components. This study examined the dynamics of salivary microstructure formation, growth, and reorganization using time-lapse imaging over 15 h. Immunofluorescence detection monitored production of individual basement membrane components forming around developing microstructures, and Ki67 assessed proliferation. Dynamic movements in hydrogels were quantified by measuring angular velocity (\u03c9) of rotating salivary microstructures and changes in basement membrane architecture during microstructure growth. Integrin involvement in the dynamic reassembly was assessed using knockdown and inhibitor approaches. Single hS/PCs expanded over 5 days into spherical microstructures typically containing 3-10 cells. In larger macrostructures, proliferation occurred near the peripheral basement membrane that underwent growth-associated cycles of thinning and collapse. De novo secretion of laminin/collagen IV from reorganizing hS/PCs preceded that of perlecan/HSPG2. Microstructures routinely expressed \u03b21 integrin-containing complexes at basement membrane-associated regions and exhibited spontaneous and coordinated rotation during basement membrane maturation. \u03b21 integrin siRNA knockdown at the single-cell state prevented hS/PC microstructure growth. After microstructure formation, \u03b21 integrin knockdown reduced rotation and mean \u03c9 by 84%. Blockade of the \u03b11 integrin subunit (CD49a) that associates with \u03b21 reduced mean \u03c9 by 66%. Studies presented here show that initial hS/PC structure growth and basement membrane maturation depends on \u03b11\u03b21-integrin mediated signaling. Coordinated cellular motility during neotissue reorganization reminiscent of salivary gland acini was critically dependent both on hS/PC-secretion of laminin,collagen type-IV, and perlecan/HSPG2 and the force-driven interactions of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin activation. We conclude that \u03b11\u03b21-integrin plays a critical role in establishing human salivary gland coordinated structure and function, and that its activation in tissue engineered systems is essential to tissue assembly.",

            "abstract":"Perlecan/HSPG2, a large heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, normally is expressed in the basement membrane (BM) underlying epithelial and endothelial cells. During prostate cancer (PCa) cell invasion, a variety of proteolytic enzymes are expressed that digest BM components including perlecan. An enzyme upregulated in invasive PCa cells, matrilysin/matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), was examined as a candidate for perlecan proteolysis both in silico and in vitro. Purified perlecan showed high sensitivity to MMP-7 digestion even when fully decorated with HS or when presented in native context connected with other BM proteins. In both conditions, MMP-7 produced discrete perlecan fragments corresponding to an origin in immunoglobulin (Ig) repeat region domain IV. While not predicted by in silico analysis, MMP-7 cleaved every subpart of recombinantly generated perlecan domain IV. Other enzymes relevant to PCa that were tested had limited ability to cleave perlecan including prostate specific antigen, hepsin, or fibroblast activation protein \u03b1. A long C-terminal portion of perlecan domain IV, Dm IV-3, induced a strong clustering phenotype in the metastatic PCa cell lines, PC-3 and C4-2. MMP-7 digestion of Dm IV-3 reverses the clustering effect into one favoring cell dispersion. In a C4-2 Transwell\u00ae invasion assay, perlecan-rich human BM extract that was pre-digested with MMP-7 showed loss of barrier function and permitted a greater level of cell penetration than untreated BM extract. We conclude that enzymatic processing of perlecan in the BM or territorial matrix by MMP-7 as occurs in the invasive tumor microenvironment acts as a molecular switch to alter PCa cell behavior and favor cell dispersion and invasiveness.",

Despite its obvious importance in skin repair and tissue homeostasis no definitive studies have immunolocalised TGF-\u03b21 in skin in WT or Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) perlecan exon 3 null mice. Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). TGF-\u03b21 was immunolocalised using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, heat retrieval and the Envision NovaRED detection system. Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes.

Primary B cells expressed a wide repertoire of PGs (dominated by serglycin and CD44) and ECM components. Lymphoblastoid EBV+ B cell lines (LCLs) showed specific PG expression with down-regulation of CD44 and ECM components and up-regulation of serglycin and perlecan/HSPG2. For Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL), serglycin was down-regulated in BL type III cells and perlecan in type I BL cells. The biosynthetic machinery for HS was active in all cell lines, with some tendency to be down-regulated in BL cells. 5'-aza-dC and/or Trichostatin A resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the genes, suggesting that low expression of ECM components, proteoglycan core proteins and HS biosynthetic system is due to epigenetic suppression in type I cells.

            "abstract":"Endochondral bone formation is a highly orchestrated process involving coordination among cell-cell, cell-matrix and growth factor signaling that eventually results in the production of mineralized bone from a cartilage template. Chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation occur in sequence during this process, and the temporospatial patterning clearly requires the activities of heparin binding growth factors and their receptors. Heparanase (HPSE) plays a role in osteogenesis, but the mechanism by which it does so is incompletely understood. We used a combination of ex vivo and in vitro approaches and a well described HPSE inhibitor, PI-88 to study HPSE in endochondral bone formation. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization with HPSE antibodies revealed that HPSE is expressed in the peri-chondrium, peri-osteum, and at the chondro-osseous junction, all sites of key signaling events and tissue morphogenesis. Transcripts encoding Hpse also were observed in the pre-hypertrophic zone. Addition of PI-88 to metatarsals in organ culture reduced growth and suggested that HPSE activity aids the transition from chondrogenic to osteogenic processes in growth of long bones. To study this, we used high density cultures of ATDC5 pre-chondrogenic cells grown under conditions favoring chondrogenesis or osteogenesis. Under chondrogenic conditions, HPSE/Hpse was expressed at high levels during the mid-culture period, at the onset of terminal chondrogenesis. PI-88 addition reduced chondrogenesis and accelerated osteogenesis, including a dramatic up-regulation of osteocalcin levels. In normal growth medium, addition of PI-88 reduced migration of ATDC-5 cells, suggesting that HPSE facilitates cartilage replacement by bone at the chondro-osseous junction by removing the HS component of proteoglycans, such as perlecan/HSPG2, that otherwise prevent osteogenic cells from remodeling hypertrophic cartilage.",

Light microscopy in the human liver with minimal changes revealed that PG-P1 was present along the hepatic sinusoids as well as fibronectin and type IV collagen, whereas laminin was only weakly detected. In portal areas, PG-P1 was only localized on basement membranes around bile duct systems and blood vessels, as well as laminin and type IV collagen, while fibronectin was scarcely detected in basement membranes. In the fibrotic liver, fibronectin was abundant in necrotic and/or newly fibrosing areas, while PG-P1 was absent in these regions. Using immunoelectron microscopy, PG-P1 was localized in the space of Disse in nearly normal livers and was only detected on basement membranes in portal tracts. In fibrotic livers, PG-P1 in the space of Disse occasionally showed a basement-membrane-like deposition in parallel with the increased light microscopical deposition of laminin in this area, suggesting the positive participation of PG-P1 in the sinusoidal capillarization. Most capillary and sinusoidal endothelial cells, and rarely bile epithelial cells revealed the reaction products of PG-P1 in their rough endoplasmic reticulum and small vesicles.

Here we report a homozygous, 89-bp duplication in exon 34 of HSPG2 in a pair of siblings with DDSH born to consanguineous parents, and heterozygous point mutations in the 5' donor site of intron 52 and in the middle of exon 73 in a third, unrelated patient, causing skipping of the entire exons 52 and 73 of the HSPG2 transcript, respectively. These mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein core. The cartilage matrix from these patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ablation of perlecan HS/CS on murine intervertebral disc development. Genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding HS biosynthetic enzymes have identified multiple roles for HS in tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we utilised an Hspg2 exon 3 null HS/CS-deficient mouse to assess the role of perlecan HS in disc cell regulation. HS makes many important contributions to growth factor sequestration, stabilisation/delivery, and activation of receptors directing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and assembly of extracellular matrix. Perlecan HS/CS-mediated interactions promote extracellular matrix assembly/stabilisation and tissue functional properties, and thus, removal of perlecan HS/CS should affect extracellular matrix function and homeostasis. Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs accumulated significantly greater glycosaminoglycan in the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and vertebral growth plates than C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) I intervertebral discs. Proliferation of intervertebral disc progenitor cells was significantly higher in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and these cells became hypertrophic by 12 weeks of age and were prominent in the vertebral growth plates but had a disorganised organisation. C57BL/6 WT vertebral growth plates contained regular columnar growth plate chondrocytes. Exostosis-like, ectopic bone formation occurred in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and differences were evident in disc cell maturation and in matrix deposition in this genotype, indicating that perlecan HS/CS chains had cell and matrix interactive properties which repressively maintained tissue homeostasis in the adult intervertebral disc.",

This study examined HS content and distribution in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues in the context of potential molecular mechanisms underlying its deregulation in brain tumours. Totally, 42 tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tissues for 31 patients with different prognosis were investigated. HS expression was demonstrated in 50-55% of the GBM tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while almost no HS content was detected in the surrounding paratumourous brain tissues. Heterogeneous HS distribution in the HS-positive tumours was more related to the necrosis or glandular-like brain zones rather than glioma cells with high or low Ki-67 index. According the Kaplan-Meier curves, HS accumulation in glioma cells was associated with low relapse-free survival (RS) of the GBM patients (p < 0.05) and was likely to be due to the increased transcriptional activity of HSPG core proteins (syndecan-1, 2-3 fold; glypican-1, 2,5 fold; perlecan/HSPG2, 13-14 fold). Activation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression correlated with the patients' survival according Kaplan-Meier (p = 0.0243) and Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR = 3.1; P(Y) = 0.03) analyses, while up-regulation of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 was not associated with the patients survival. Taken together, the results indicate that increase of HS content and up-regulation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression in glioblastoma tissues contribute to tumour development through the transformation of brain extracellular matrix into tumour microenvironment, and represent negative prognostic factors for glioblastoma progression.",

            "abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the role of the perlecan (Hspg2) heparan sulphate (HS) side chains on cell and matrix homeostasis in tail and Achilles tendons in 3 and 12 week old Hspg2 exon 3 null HS deficient (Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 -) and C57 BL/6 Wild Type (WT) mice. Perlecan has important cell regulatory and matrix organizational properties through HS mediated interactions with a range of growth factors and morphogens and with structural extracellular matrix glycoproteins which define tissue function and allow the resident cells to regulate tissue homeostasis. It was expected that ablation of the HS chains on perlecan would severely disrupt normal tendon organization and functional properties and it was envisaged that this study would better define the role of HS in normal tendon function and in tendon repair processes. Tail and Achilles tendons from each genotype were biomechanically tested (ultimate tensile stress (UTS), tensile modulus (TM)) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) compositional analyses were undertaken. Tenocytes were isolated from tail tendons from each mouse genotype and grown in monolayer culture. These cultures were undertaken in the presence of FGF-2 to assess the cell signaling properties of each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from 3-12 week old tail and Achilles tendons and qRT-PCR was undertaken to assess the expression of the following genes Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1. Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FGF-2 stimulated tenocyte monolayers displayed elevated Adamts4, Mmp2, 3, 13 mRNA levels compared to WT mice. Non-stimulated tendon Col1A1, Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1 mRNA levels showed no major differences between the two genotypes other than a decline with ageing while LTBP2 expression increased. Eln expression also declined to a greater extent in the perlecan exon 3 null mice (P < 0.05). Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This indicated a more compact form of collagen localization in the perlecan exon 3 null mice. Collagen fibrils were also smaller by TEM, which may facilitate a more condensed fibril packing accounting for the superior UTS displayed by the perlecan exon 3 null mice. The amplified catabolic phenotype of Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - mice may account for the age-dependent decline in GAG observed in tail tendon over 3 to 12 weeks. After Achilles tenotomy Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - and WT mice had similar rates of recovery of UTS and TM over 12 weeks post operatively indicating that a deficiency of HS was not detrimental to tendon repair.",

            "abstract":"Growth factor gradients orchestrate many biological processes including organogenesis, wound healing, cancer invasion, and metastasis. Heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF) gradients are established in living systems by proteoglycans including the extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan/HSPG2. Three potential HBGF-binding glycosaminoglycan attachment sites occur in N-terminal domain I of perlecan's five domains. Our overarching goal was to form stable, biomimetic non-covalently bound HBGF gradients surrounding cells encapsulated in hyaluronate-based hydrogels by first establishing perlecan domain I (PlnD1) gradients. A versatile multichannel gradient maker device (MGMD) was designed and 3D printed, then used to create desired gradients of microparticles in hydrogels. Next, we used the device to covalently incorporate gradients of PEGylated PlnD1 in hydrogels with high-low-high or high-medium-low concentrations across the hydrogel width. Fluorescently-labeled fibroblast growth factor-2 was delivered to hydrogels in phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to electrostatically bind to the covalently pre-incorporated PlnD1, producing stable non-covalent HBGF gradients. To test cell viability after flow through the MGMD, delicate primary human salivary stem/progenitor cells were encapsulated in gradient hydrogels where they showed high viability and continued to grow. Next, to test migratory behavior in response to HBGF gradients, two cell types, preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were encapsulated in or adjacent to PlnD1-modified hydrogels. Both cell lines migrated toward HBGFs bound to PlnD1. We conclude that establishing covalently-bound PlnD1 gradients in hydrogels provides a new means to establish physiologically-relevant gradients of HBGFs that are useful for a variety of applications in tissue engineering and cancer biology. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Gradients of heparin binding growth factors (HBGFs) direct cell behavior in living systems. HBGFs bind electrostatically to gradients of HS proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix creating HBGF gradients. We recreated HBGF gradients in physiological hyaluronate-based hydrogels using a 3D-printed multichannel gradient maker device (MGMD) that created gradients of HS proteoglycan-derived perlecan/HSPG2 domain I. We demonstrated the ability of a variety of cells, including primary salivary stem/progenitor cells, pre-osteoblastic cells and an invasive breast cancer cell line, to be co-encapsulated in gradient hydrogels by flowing them together through the MGMD. The versatile device and the ability to create HBGF gradients in hydrogels for a variety of applications is innovative and of broad utility in both cancer biology and tissue engineering applications.",

It sequesters growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and regulates the ligand-receptor interactions on the cell surface, and thus it has been implicated in the control of angiogenesis. Both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of perlecan on FGF-2 signaling have been reported. To understand the in vivo function of HS carried by perlecan, the perlecan gene heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (Hspg2) was mutated in mouse by gene targeting. The HS at the NH(2) terminus of perlecan was removed while the core protein remained intact. Perlecan HS-deficient (Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3)) mice survived embryonic development and were apparently healthy as adults. However, mutant mice exhibited significantly delayed wound healing, retarded FGF-2-induced tumor growth, and defective angiogenesis. In the mouse corneal angiogenesis model, FGF-2-induced neovascularization was significantly impaired in Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mutant mice. Our results suggest that HS in perlecan positively regulates the angiogenesis in vivo.",

Despite its obvious importance in skin repair and tissue homeostasis no definitive studies have immunolocalised TGF-\u03b21 in skin in WT or Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) perlecan exon 3 null mice. Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). TGF-\u03b21 was immunolocalised using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, heat retrieval and the Envision NovaRED detection system. Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes.

Salivary human stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) were isolated from healthy regions of parotid glands of head and neck surgery patients, expanded, then encapsulated in biocompatible hyaluronate (HA)-based hydrogels. These bioactive hydrogels provide a surrogate territorial matrix suitable for the dynamic assembly, growth and reorganization of salivary gland components. This study examined the dynamics of salivary microstructure formation, growth, and reorganization using time-lapse imaging over 15 h. Immunofluorescence detection monitored production of individual basement membrane components forming around developing microstructures, and Ki67 assessed proliferation. Dynamic movements in hydrogels were quantified by measuring angular velocity (\u03c9) of rotating salivary microstructures and changes in basement membrane architecture during microstructure growth. Integrin involvement in the dynamic reassembly was assessed using knockdown and inhibitor approaches. Single hS/PCs expanded over 5 days into spherical microstructures typically containing 3-10 cells. In larger macrostructures, proliferation occurred near the peripheral basement membrane that underwent growth-associated cycles of thinning and collapse. De novo secretion of laminin/collagen IV from reorganizing hS/PCs preceded that of perlecan/HSPG2. Microstructures routinely expressed \u03b21 integrin-containing complexes at basement membrane-associated regions and exhibited spontaneous and coordinated rotation during basement membrane maturation. \u03b21 integrin siRNA knockdown at the single-cell state prevented hS/PC microstructure growth. After microstructure formation, \u03b21 integrin knockdown reduced rotation and mean \u03c9 by 84%. Blockade of the \u03b11 integrin subunit (CD49a) that associates with \u03b21 reduced mean \u03c9 by 66%. Studies presented here show that initial hS/PC structure growth and basement membrane maturation depends on \u03b11\u03b21-integrin mediated signaling. Coordinated cellular motility during neotissue reorganization reminiscent of salivary gland acini was critically dependent both on hS/PC-secretion of laminin,collagen type-IV, and perlecan/HSPG2 and the force-driven interactions of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin activation. We conclude that \u03b11\u03b21-integrin plays a critical role in establishing human salivary gland coordinated structure and function, and that its activation in tissue engineered systems is essential to tissue assembly.",

            "abstract":"Glycosaminoglycans are major components of brain extracellular matrix (ECM), although heparan sulfate (HS) contribution in brain physiology and carcinogenesis remains underinvestigated. This study examined HS content and distribution in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues in the context of potential molecular mechanisms underlying its deregulation in brain tumours. Totally, 42 tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tissues for 31 patients with different prognosis were investigated. HS expression was demonstrated in 50-55% of the GBM tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while almost no HS content was detected in the surrounding paratumourous brain tissues. Heterogeneous HS distribution in the HS-positive tumours was more related to the necrosis or glandular-like brain zones rather than glioma cells with high or low Ki-67 index. According the Kaplan-Meier curves, HS accumulation in glioma cells was associated with low relapse-free survival (RS) of the GBM patients (p < 0.05) and was likely to be due to the increased transcriptional activity of HSPG core proteins (syndecan-1, 2-3 fold; glypican-1, 2,5 fold; perlecan/HSPG2, 13-14 fold). Activation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression correlated with the patients' survival according Kaplan-Meier (p = 0.0243) and Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR = 3.1; P(Y) = 0.03) analyses, while up-regulation of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 was not associated with the patients survival. Taken together, the results indicate that increase of HS content and up-regulation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression in glioblastoma tissues contribute to tumour development through the transformation of brain extracellular matrix into tumour microenvironment, and represent negative prognostic factors for glioblastoma progression.",

Perlecan is the predominant HS proteoglycan in the artery wall. Here, we investigated the role of perlecan HS chains using apoE null (ApoE0) mice that were cross-bred with mice expressing HS-deficient perlecan (Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3)). Morphometry of cross-sections from aortic roots and en face preparations of whole aortas revealed a significant decrease in lesion formation in ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mice at both 15 and 33 weeks. In vitro, binding of labeled mouse triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and human LDL to total extracellular matrix, as well as to purified proteoglycans, prepared from ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) smooth muscle cells was reduced. In vivo, at 20 minutes influx of human (125)I-LDL or mouse triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into the aortic wall was increased in ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mice compared to ApoE0 mice. However, at 72 hours accumulation of (125)I-LDL was similar in ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) and ApoE0 mice. Immunohistochemistry of lesions from ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mice showed decreased staining for apoB and increased smooth muscle alpha-actin content, whereas accumulation of CD68-positive inflammatory cells was unchanged. We conclude that the perlecan HS chains are proatherogenic in mice, possibly through increased lipoprotein retention, altered vascular permeability, or other mechanisms. The ability of HS to inhibit smooth muscle cell growth may also influence development as well as instability of lesions.",

LTBP-2 was a prominent pericellular component of annular fibrochondrocytes in the posterior annulus fibrosus (AF), interstitial matrix adjacent to nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and to fibrillar and cell associated material in the anterior AF of the human foetal IVD and also displayed a pericellular localisation pattern in murine IVDs.

Versican was a prominent fibril-associated component in the posterior and anterior AF, localised in close proximity to fibrillin-1 in fibrillar arrangements in the cartilaginous vertebral rudiments around paraspinal blood vessels, to major collagen fibre bundles in the anterior and posterior AF and shorter fibres in the NP. Fibrillin-1 was prominent in the outer anterior AF of the human foetal IVD and in fibres extending from the AF into the cartilaginous vertebral rudiments.

Primary B cells expressed a wide repertoire of PGs (dominated by serglycin and CD44) and ECM components. Lymphoblastoid EBV+ B cell lines (LCLs) showed specific PG expression with down-regulation of CD44 and ECM components and up-regulation of serglycin and perlecan/HSPG2. For Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL), serglycin was down-regulated in BL type III cells and perlecan in type I BL cells. The biosynthetic machinery for HS was active in all cell lines, with some tendency to be down-regulated in BL cells. 5'-aza-dC and/or Trichostatin A resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the genes, suggesting that low expression of ECM components, proteoglycan core proteins and HS biosynthetic system is due to epigenetic suppression in type I cells.

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E).

Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes.

            "abstract":"The heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2)/perlecan gene is ancient and conserved in all triploblastic species. Its presence maintains critical cell boundaries in tissue and its large (up to ~900 kDa) modular structure has prompted speculation about the evolutionary origin of the gene. The gene's conservation amongst basal metazoans is unclear. After the recent sequencing of their genomes, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis and the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens have become favorite models for studying tissue regeneration and the evolution of multicellularity. More ancient basal metazoan phyla include the poriferan and ctenophore, whose evolutionary relationship has been clarified recently. Our in silico and PCR-based methods indicate that the HSPG2 gene is conserved in both the placozoan and cnidarian genomes, but not in those of the ctenophores and only partly in poriferan genomes. HSPG2 also is absent from published ctenophore and Capsaspora owczarzaki genomes. The gene in T. adhaerens is encoded as two separate but genetically juxtaposed genes that house all of the constituent pieces of the mammalian HSPG2 gene in tandem. These genetic constituents are found in isolated genes of various poriferan species, indicating a possible intronic recombinatory mechanism for assembly of the HSPG2 gene. Perlecan's expression during wound healing and boundary formation is conserved, as expression of the gene was activated during tissue regeneration and reformation of the basement membrane of N. vectensis. These data indicate that the complex HSPG2 gene evolved concurrently in a common ancestor of placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians, likely along with the development of differentiated cell types separated by acellular matrices, and is activated to reestablish these tissue borders during wound healing.",

Despite its obvious importance in skin repair and tissue homeostasis no definitive studies have immunolocalised TGF-\u03b21 in skin in WT or Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) perlecan exon 3 null mice. Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). TGF-\u03b21 was immunolocalised using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, heat retrieval and the Envision NovaRED detection system. Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes. TGF-\u03b21 also has cell mediated effects in tissue homeostasis and matrix stabilisation a reduction in TGF-\u03b21 deposition would therefore be expected to detrimentally impact on skin homeostasis in the perlecan mutant mice.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ablation of perlecan HS/CS on murine intervertebral disc development. Genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding HS biosynthetic enzymes have identified multiple roles for HS in tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we utilised an Hspg2 exon 3 null HS/CS-deficient mouse to assess the role of perlecan HS in disc cell regulation. HS makes many important contributions to growth factor sequestration, stabilisation/delivery, and activation of receptors directing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and assembly of extracellular matrix. Perlecan HS/CS-mediated interactions promote extracellular matrix assembly/stabilisation and tissue functional properties, and thus, removal of perlecan HS/CS should affect extracellular matrix function and homeostasis. Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs accumulated significantly greater glycosaminoglycan in the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and vertebral growth plates than C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) I intervertebral discs. Proliferation of intervertebral disc progenitor cells was significantly higher in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and these cells became hypertrophic by 12 weeks of age and were prominent in the vertebral growth plates but had a disorganised organisation. C57BL/6 WT vertebral growth plates contained regular columnar growth plate chondrocytes. Exostosis-like, ectopic bone formation occurred in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and differences were evident in disc cell maturation and in matrix deposition in this genotype, indicating that perlecan HS/CS chains had cell and matrix interactive properties which repressively maintained tissue homeostasis in the adult intervertebral disc.",

Perlecan has important cell regulatory and matrix organizational properties through HS mediated interactions with a range of growth factors and morphogens and with structural extracellular matrix glycoproteins which define tissue function and allow the resident cells to regulate tissue homeostasis. It was expected that ablation of the HS chains on perlecan would severely disrupt normal tendon organization and functional properties and it was envisaged that this study would better define the role of HS in normal tendon function and in tendon repair processes. Tail and Achilles tendons from each genotype were biomechanically tested (ultimate tensile stress (UTS), tensile modulus (TM)) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) compositional analyses were undertaken. Tenocytes were isolated from tail tendons from each mouse genotype and grown in monolayer culture. These cultures were undertaken in the presence of FGF-2 to assess the cell signaling properties of each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from 3-12 week old tail and Achilles tendons and qRT-PCR was undertaken to assess the expression of the following genes Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1. Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FGF-2 stimulated tenocyte monolayers displayed elevated Adamts4, Mmp2, 3, 13 mRNA levels compared to WT mice. Non-stimulated tendon Col1A1, Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1 mRNA levels showed no major differences between the two genotypes other than a decline with ageing while LTBP2 expression increased. Eln expression also declined to a greater extent in the perlecan exon 3 null mice (P < 0.05). Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This indicated a more compact form of collagen localization in the perlecan exon 3 null mice. Collagen fibrils were also smaller by TEM, which may facilitate a more condensed fibril packing accounting for the superior UTS displayed by the perlecan exon 3 null mice. The amplified catabolic phenotype of Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - mice may account for the age-dependent decline in GAG observed in tail tendon over 3 to 12 weeks. After Achilles tenotomy Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - and WT mice had similar rates of recovery of UTS and TM over 12 weeks post operatively indicating that a deficiency of HS was not detrimental to tendon repair.",

This study examined HS content and distribution in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues in the context of potential molecular mechanisms underlying its deregulation in brain tumours. Totally, 42 tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tissues for 31 patients with different prognosis were investigated. HS expression was demonstrated in 50-55% of the GBM tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while almost no HS content was detected in the surrounding paratumourous brain tissues. Heterogeneous HS distribution in the HS-positive tumours was more related to the necrosis or glandular-like brain zones rather than glioma cells with high or low Ki-67 index. According the Kaplan-Meier curves, HS accumulation in glioma cells was associated with low relapse-free survival (RS) of the GBM patients (p < 0.05) and was likely to be due to the increased transcriptional activity of HSPG core proteins (syndecan-1, 2-3 fold; glypican-1, 2,5 fold; perlecan/HSPG2, 13-14 fold). Activation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression correlated with the patients' survival according Kaplan-Meier (p = 0.0243) and Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR = 3.1; P(Y) = 0.03) analyses, while up-regulation of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 was not associated with the patients survival. Taken together, the results indicate that increase of HS content and up-regulation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression in glioblastoma tissues contribute to tumour development through the transformation of brain extracellular matrix into tumour microenvironment, and represent negative prognostic factors for glioblastoma progression.",

This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

            "abstract":"Perlecan/heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2), a large HSPG, is indispensable for the development of musculoskeletal tissues, where it is deposited within the pericellular matrix (PCM) surrounding chondrocytes and disappears nearly completely at the chondro-osseous junction (COJ) of developing long bones. Destruction of perlecan at the COJ converts an avascular cartilage compartment into one that permits blood vessel infiltration and osteogenesis. Mutations in perlecan are associated with chondrodysplasia with widespread musculoskeletal and joint defects. This study elucidated novel signaling roles of perlecan core protein in endochondral bone formation and chondrocyte behavior. Perlecan subdomains were tested for chondrogenic properties in ATDC5 cells, a model for early chondrogenesis. A region within domain IV of perlecan (HSPG2 IV-3) was found to promote rapid prechondrocyte clustering. Introduction of the mutation (R3452Q) associated with the human skeletal disorder Schwartz-Jampel syndrome limited HSPG2 IV-3-induced clustering. HSPG2 IV-3 activity was enhanced when thermally unfolded, likely because of increased exposure of the active motif(s). HSPG2 IV-3-induced clustering was accompanied by the deactivation of key components of the focal adhesion complex, FAK and Src, with increased messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of precartilage condensation markers Sox9 and N-cadherin ( Cdh2), and cartilage PCM components collagen II ( Col2a1) and aggrecan ( Acan). HSPG2 IV-3 reduced signaling through the ERK pathway, where loss of ERK1/2 phosphorylation coincided with reduced FoxM1 protein levels and increased mRNA levels cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (Cdkn1c) and activating transcription factor 3 ( Atf3), reducing cell proliferation. These findings point to a critical role for perlecan domain IV in cartilage development through triggering chondrocyte condensation.",

            "abstract":"Heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) is an essential, highly conserved gene whose expression influences many developmental processes including the formation of the heart and brain. The gene is widely expressed throughout the musculoskeletal system including cartilage, bone marrow and skeletal muscle. The HSPG2 gene product, perlecan is a multifunctional proteoglycan that preserves the integrity of extracellular matrices, patrols tissue borders, and controls various signaling pathways affecting cellular phenotype. Given HSPG2's expression pattern and its role in so many fundamental processes, it is not surprising that relatively few gene mutations have been identified in viable organisms. Mutations to the perlecan gene are rare, with effects ranging from a relatively mild condition to a more severe and perinatally lethal form. This review will summarize the important studies characterizing mutations and variants of HSPG2 and discuss how these genomic modifications affect expression, function and phenotype. Additionally, this review will describe the clinical findings of reported HSPG2 mutations and their observed phenotypes. Finally, the evolutionary aspects that link gene integrity to function are discussed, including key findings from both in vivo animal studies and in vitro systems. We also hope to facilitate discussion about perlecan/HSPG2 and its role in normal physiology, to explain how mutation can lead to pathology, and to point out how this information can suggest pathways for future mechanistic studies.",

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFR\u03b2 up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan (Hspg2)-deficient (Hspg2 - / - -TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas Hspg2 - / - -TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2, SHP-2, and FAK partially through integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFR\u03b2 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.",

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",

            "abstract":"Perlecan/heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2), a large HSPG, is indispensable for the development of musculoskeletal tissues, where it is deposited within the pericellular matrix (PCM) surrounding chondrocytes and disappears nearly completely at the chondro-osseous junction (COJ) of developing long bones. Destruction of perlecan at the COJ converts an avascular cartilage compartment into one that permits blood vessel infiltration and osteogenesis. Mutations in perlecan are associated with chondrodysplasia with widespread musculoskeletal and joint defects. This study elucidated novel signaling roles of perlecan core protein in endochondral bone formation and chondrocyte behavior. Perlecan subdomains were tested for chondrogenic properties in ATDC5 cells, a model for early chondrogenesis. A region within domain IV of perlecan (HSPG2 IV-3) was found to promote rapid prechondrocyte clustering. Introduction of the mutation (R3452Q) associated with the human skeletal disorder Schwartz-Jampel syndrome limited HSPG2 IV-3-induced clustering. HSPG2 IV-3 activity was enhanced when thermally unfolded, likely because of increased exposure of the active motif(s). HSPG2 IV-3-induced clustering was accompanied by the deactivation of key components of the focal adhesion complex, FAK and Src, with increased messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of precartilage condensation markers Sox9 and N-cadherin ( Cdh2), and cartilage PCM components collagen II ( Col2a1) and aggrecan ( Acan). HSPG2 IV-3 reduced signaling through the ERK pathway, where loss of ERK1/2 phosphorylation coincided with reduced FoxM1 protein levels and increased mRNA levels cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (Cdkn1c) and activating transcription factor 3 ( Atf3), reducing cell proliferation. These findings point to a critical role for perlecan domain IV in cartilage development through triggering chondrocyte condensation.",

Despite its obvious importance in skin repair and tissue homeostasis no definitive studies have immunolocalised TGF-\u03b21 in skin in WT or Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) perlecan exon 3 null mice. Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). TGF-\u03b21 was immunolocalised using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, heat retrieval and the Envision NovaRED detection system. Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes.

However, treatment options for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are quite limited due to a lack of identifiable, unique markers. Using a phage display-based whole cell biopanning procedure, we developed two human antibodies that bind to tumor cells with a metastatic TNBC phenotype. Our studies further identified domain 1 of HSPG2 (perlecan) protein as the cognate cell surface antigen bound by the antibody. Immunohistochemistry studies utilizing patient tissue samples revealed significant cell surface expression of HSPG2 in both primary tumors and metastatic lesions. Further, higher HSPG2 expression correlated with poor survival in TNBC. The affinity-matured antibody inhibited the growth of triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors to a greater extent in nude mice than in NSG mice, pointing to the potential role of natural killer cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. This mechanism of action was confirmed through in vitro assays using mouse splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These results suggest that HSPG2 is a promising target in metastatic TNBC and HSPG2-targeted antibodies could represent a potentially novel class of targeted therapeutics for TNBC.",

Here, we show physiological roles of perlecan in both obesity and the onset of metabolic syndrome. The perinatal lethality-rescued perlecan knockout (Hspg2-/--Tg) mice showed a smaller mass and cell size of white adipose tissues than control (WT-Tg) mice. Abnormal lipid deposition, such as fatty liver, was not detected in the Hspg2-/--Tg mice, and those mice also consumed more fat as an energy source, likely due to their activated fatty acid oxidation. In addition, the Hspg2-/--Tg mice demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity. Molecular analysis revealed the significantly relatively increased amount of the muscle fiber type IIA (X) isoform and a larger quantity of mitochondria in the skeletal muscle of Hspg2-/--Tg mice. Furthermore, the perlecan-deficient skeletal muscle also had elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) protein. PGC1\u03b1 expression is activated by exercise, and induces mitochondrial biosynthesis. Thus, perlecan may act as a mechano-regulator of catabolism of both lipids and glucose by shifting the muscle fiber composition to oxidative fibers.

This study examined HS content and distribution in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues in the context of potential molecular mechanisms underlying its deregulation in brain tumours. Totally, 42 tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tissues for 31 patients with different prognosis were investigated. HS expression was demonstrated in 50-55% of the GBM tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while almost no HS content was detected in the surrounding paratumourous brain tissues. Heterogeneous HS distribution in the HS-positive tumours was more related to the necrosis or glandular-like brain zones rather than glioma cells with high or low Ki-67 index. According the Kaplan-Meier curves, HS accumulation in glioma cells was associated with low relapse-free survival (RS) of the GBM patients (p < 0.05) and was likely to be due to the increased transcriptional activity of HSPG core proteins (syndecan-1, 2-3 fold; glypican-1, 2,5 fold; perlecan/HSPG2, 13-14 fold). Activation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression correlated with the patients' survival according Kaplan-Meier (p = 0.0243) and Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR = 3.1; P(Y) = 0.03) analyses, while up-regulation of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 was not associated with the patients survival. Taken together, the results indicate that increase of HS content and up-regulation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression in glioblastoma tissues contribute to tumour development through the transformation of brain extracellular matrix into tumour microenvironment, and represent negative prognostic factors for glioblastoma progression.",

Salivary human stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) were isolated from healthy regions of parotid glands of head and neck surgery patients, expanded, then encapsulated in biocompatible hyaluronate (HA)-based hydrogels. These bioactive hydrogels provide a surrogate territorial matrix suitable for the dynamic assembly, growth and reorganization of salivary gland components. This study examined the dynamics of salivary microstructure formation, growth, and reorganization using time-lapse imaging over 15 h. Immunofluorescence detection monitored production of individual basement membrane components forming around developing microstructures, and Ki67 assessed proliferation. Dynamic movements in hydrogels were quantified by measuring angular velocity (\u03c9) of rotating salivary microstructures and changes in basement membrane architecture during microstructure growth. Integrin involvement in the dynamic reassembly was assessed using knockdown and inhibitor approaches. Single hS/PCs expanded over 5 days into spherical microstructures typically containing 3-10 cells. In larger macrostructures, proliferation occurred near the peripheral basement membrane that underwent growth-associated cycles of thinning and collapse. De novo secretion of laminin/collagen IV from reorganizing hS/PCs preceded that of perlecan/HSPG2. Microstructures routinely expressed \u03b21 integrin-containing complexes at basement membrane-associated regions and exhibited spontaneous and coordinated rotation during basement membrane maturation. \u03b21 integrin siRNA knockdown at the single-cell state prevented hS/PC microstructure growth. After microstructure formation, \u03b21 integrin knockdown reduced rotation and mean \u03c9 by 84%. Blockade of the \u03b11 integrin subunit (CD49a) that associates with \u03b21 reduced mean \u03c9 by 66%. Studies presented here show that initial hS/PC structure growth and basement membrane maturation depends on \u03b11\u03b21-integrin mediated signaling. Coordinated cellular motility during neotissue reorganization reminiscent of salivary gland acini was critically dependent both on hS/PC-secretion of laminin,collagen type-IV, and perlecan/HSPG2 and the force-driven interactions of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin activation. We conclude that \u03b11\u03b21-integrin plays a critical role in establishing human salivary gland coordinated structure and function, and that its activation in tissue engineered systems is essential to tissue assembly.",

The intact proteoglycan inhibits the smooth muscle cell (SMC) response to vascular injury. Hspg2(\u03943/\u03943) (M\u03943/\u03943) mice produce a mutant perlecan lacking the HS side chains. The objective of this study was to determine differences between these two types of perlecan in modifying SMC activities to the arterial injury response, in order to define the specific role of the HS side chains. In vitro proliferative and migratory activities were compared in SMC isolated from M\u03943/\u03943 and wild-type mice. Proliferation of M\u03943/\u03943 SMC was 1.5\u00d7 greater than in wild type (P < 0.001), increased by addition of growth factors, and showed a 42% greater migratory response than wild-type cells to PDGF-BB (P < 0.001). In M\u03943/\u03943 SMC adhesion to fibronectin, and collagen types I and IV was significantly greater than wild type. Addition of DRL-12582, an inducer of perlecan expression, decreased proliferation and migratory response to PDGF-BB stimulation in wild-type SMC compared with M\u03943/\u03943. In an in vivo carotid artery wire injury model, the medial thickness, medial area/lumen ratio, and macrophage infiltration were significantly increased in the M\u03943/\u03943 mice, indicating a prominent role of the HS side chain in limiting vascular injury response.

Primary B cells expressed a wide repertoire of PGs (dominated by serglycin and CD44) and ECM components. Lymphoblastoid EBV+ B cell lines (LCLs) showed specific PG expression with down-regulation of CD44 and ECM components and up-regulation of serglycin and perlecan/HSPG2. For Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL), serglycin was down-regulated in BL type III cells and perlecan in type I BL cells. The biosynthetic machinery for HS was active in all cell lines, with some tendency to be down-regulated in BL cells. 5'-aza-dC and/or Trichostatin A resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the genes, suggesting that low expression of ECM components, proteoglycan core proteins and HS biosynthetic system is due to epigenetic suppression in type I cells.

HS is known to covalently attach to core proteins to form heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface. The HSPG core proteins include the membrane-spanning syndecans (SDCs), the lycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glypicans (GPCs), the basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan (HSPG2), and agrin. In the present study, we have profiled each of the HSPG core proteins in HCV attachment. Substantial evidence derived from our studies demonstrates that SDC1 is the major receptor protein for HCV attachment. The knockdown of SDC1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced gene silence resulted in a significant reduction of HCV attachment to Huh-7.5 cells and stem cell-differentiated human hepatocytes. The silence of SDC2 expression also caused a modest decrease of HCV attachment. In contrast, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of other SDCs, GPCs, HSPG2, and agrin had no effect on HCV attachment. More importantly, ectopic expression of SDC1 was able to completely restore HCV attachment to Huh-7.5 cells in which the endogenous SDC1 expression was silenced by specific siRNAs. Interestingly, mouse SDC1 is also fully functional in mediating HCV attachment when expressed in the SDC1-deficient cells, consistent with recent reports that mouse hepatocytes are also susceptible to HCV infection when expressing other key HCV receptors. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SDC1 serves as the major receptor protein for HCV attachment to cells, providing another potential target for discovery and development of antiviral drugs against HCV.",

We used a combination of ex vivo and in vitro approaches and a well described HPSE inhibitor, PI-88 to study HPSE in endochondral bone formation. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization with HPSE antibodies revealed that HPSE is expressed in the peri-chondrium, peri-osteum, and at the chondro-osseous junction, all sites of key signaling events and tissue morphogenesis. Transcripts encoding Hpse also were observed in the pre-hypertrophic zone. Addition of PI-88 to metatarsals in organ culture reduced growth and suggested that HPSE activity aids the transition from chondrogenic to osteogenic processes in growth of long bones. To study this, we used high density cultures of ATDC5 pre-chondrogenic cells grown under conditions favoring chondrogenesis or osteogenesis. Under chondrogenic conditions, HPSE/Hpse was expressed at high levels during the mid-culture period, at the onset of terminal chondrogenesis. PI-88 addition reduced chondrogenesis and accelerated osteogenesis, including a dramatic up-regulation of osteocalcin levels. In normal growth medium, addition of PI-88 reduced migration of ATDC-5 cells, suggesting that HPSE facilitates cartilage replacement by bone at the chondro-osseous junction by removing the HS component of proteoglycans, such as perlecan/HSPG2, that otherwise prevent osteogenic cells from remodeling hypertrophic cartilage.",

Mice lacking the perlecan gene (Hspg2) have a severe chondrodysplasia with dyssegmental ossification of the spine and show radiographic, clinical and chondro-osseous morphology similar to a lethal autosomal recessive disorder in humans termed dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH; MIM 224410). Here we report a homozygous, 89-bp duplication in exon 34 of HSPG2 in a pair of siblings with DDSH born to consanguineous parents, and heterozygous point mutations in the 5' donor site of intron 52 and in the middle of exon 73 in a third, unrelated patient, causing skipping of the entire exons 52 and 73 of the HSPG2 transcript, respectively. These mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein core. The cartilage matrix from these patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies. Biochemically, truncated perlecan was not secreted by the patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller fragments within the cells. Thus, DDSH is caused by a functional null mutation of HSPG2. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of perlecan in cartilage development.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ablation of perlecan HS/CS on murine intervertebral disc development. Genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding HS biosynthetic enzymes have identified multiple roles for HS in tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we utilised an Hspg2 exon 3 null HS/CS-deficient mouse to assess the role of perlecan HS in disc cell regulation. HS makes many important contributions to growth factor sequestration, stabilisation/delivery, and activation of receptors directing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and assembly of extracellular matrix. Perlecan HS/CS-mediated interactions promote extracellular matrix assembly/stabilisation and tissue functional properties, and thus, removal of perlecan HS/CS should affect extracellular matrix function and homeostasis. Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs accumulated significantly greater glycosaminoglycan in the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and vertebral growth plates than C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) I intervertebral discs. Proliferation of intervertebral disc progenitor cells was significantly higher in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and these cells became hypertrophic by 12 weeks of age and were prominent in the vertebral growth plates but had a disorganised organisation. C57BL/6 WT vertebral growth plates contained regular columnar growth plate chondrocytes. Exostosis-like, ectopic bone formation occurred in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and differences were evident in disc cell maturation and in matrix deposition in this genotype, indicating that perlecan HS/CS chains had cell and matrix interactive properties which repressively maintained tissue homeostasis in the adult intervertebral disc.",

            "abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the role of the perlecan (Hspg2) heparan sulphate (HS) side chains on cell and matrix homeostasis in tail and Achilles tendons in 3 and 12 week old Hspg2 exon 3 null HS deficient (Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 -) and C57 BL/6 Wild Type (WT) mice. Perlecan has important cell regulatory and matrix organizational properties through HS mediated interactions with a range of growth factors and morphogens and with structural extracellular matrix glycoproteins which define tissue function and allow the resident cells to regulate tissue homeostasis. It was expected that ablation of the HS chains on perlecan would severely disrupt normal tendon organization and functional properties and it was envisaged that this study would better define the role of HS in normal tendon function and in tendon repair processes. Tail and Achilles tendons from each genotype were biomechanically tested (ultimate tensile stress (UTS), tensile modulus (TM)) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) compositional analyses were undertaken. Tenocytes were isolated from tail tendons from each mouse genotype and grown in monolayer culture. These cultures were undertaken in the presence of FGF-2 to assess the cell signaling properties of each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from 3-12 week old tail and Achilles tendons and qRT-PCR was undertaken to assess the expression of the following genes Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1. Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FGF-2 stimulated tenocyte monolayers displayed elevated Adamts4, Mmp2, 3, 13 mRNA levels compared to WT mice. Non-stimulated tendon Col1A1, Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1 mRNA levels showed no major differences between the two genotypes other than a decline with ageing while LTBP2 expression increased. Eln expression also declined to a greater extent in the perlecan exon 3 null mice (P < 0.05). Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This indicated a more compact form of collagen localization in the perlecan exon 3 null mice. Collagen fibrils were also smaller by TEM, which may facilitate a more condensed fibril packing accounting for the superior UTS displayed by the perlecan exon 3 null mice. The amplified catabolic phenotype of Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - mice may account for the age-dependent decline in GAG observed in tail tendon over 3 to 12 weeks. After Achilles tenotomy Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - and WT mice had similar rates of recovery of UTS and TM over 12 weeks post operatively indicating that a deficiency of HS was not detrimental to tendon repair.",

Primary B cells expressed a wide repertoire of PGs (dominated by serglycin and CD44) and ECM components. Lymphoblastoid EBV+ B cell lines (LCLs) showed specific PG expression with down-regulation of CD44 and ECM components and up-regulation of serglycin and perlecan/HSPG2. For Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL), serglycin was down-regulated in BL type III cells and perlecan in type I BL cells. The biosynthetic machinery for HS was active in all cell lines, with some tendency to be down-regulated in BL cells. 5'-aza-dC and/or Trichostatin A resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the genes, suggesting that low expression of ECM components, proteoglycan core proteins and HS biosynthetic system is due to epigenetic suppression in type I cells.

            "abstract":"Endochondral bone formation is a highly orchestrated process involving coordination among cell-cell, cell-matrix and growth factor signaling that eventually results in the production of mineralized bone from a cartilage template. Chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation occur in sequence during this process, and the temporospatial patterning clearly requires the activities of heparin binding growth factors and their receptors. Heparanase (HPSE) plays a role in osteogenesis, but the mechanism by which it does so is incompletely understood. We used a combination of ex vivo and in vitro approaches and a well described HPSE inhibitor, PI-88 to study HPSE in endochondral bone formation. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization with HPSE antibodies revealed that HPSE is expressed in the peri-chondrium, peri-osteum, and at the chondro-osseous junction, all sites of key signaling events and tissue morphogenesis. Transcripts encoding Hpse also were observed in the pre-hypertrophic zone. Addition of PI-88 to metatarsals in organ culture reduced growth and suggested that HPSE activity aids the transition from chondrogenic to osteogenic processes in growth of long bones. To study this, we used high density cultures of ATDC5 pre-chondrogenic cells grown under conditions favoring chondrogenesis or osteogenesis. Under chondrogenic conditions, HPSE/Hpse was expressed at high levels during the mid-culture period, at the onset of terminal chondrogenesis. PI-88 addition reduced chondrogenesis and accelerated osteogenesis, including a dramatic up-regulation of osteocalcin levels. In normal growth medium, addition of PI-88 reduced migration of ATDC-5 cells, suggesting that HPSE facilitates cartilage replacement by bone at the chondro-osseous junction by removing the HS component of proteoglycans, such as perlecan/HSPG2, that otherwise prevent osteogenic cells from remodeling hypertrophic cartilage.",

HS-42, which is a monoclonal antibody to PG-P1 and is reported to recognize a heparan sulfate proteoglycan named HSPG2/perlecan, was used for this purpose. Light microscopy in the human liver with minimal changes revealed that PG-P1 was present along the hepatic sinusoids as well as fibronectin and type IV collagen, whereas laminin was only weakly detected. In portal areas, PG-P1 was only localized on basement membranes around bile duct systems and blood vessels, as well as laminin and type IV collagen, while fibronectin was scarcely detected in basement membranes. In the fibrotic liver, fibronectin was abundant in necrotic and/or newly fibrosing areas, while PG-P1 was absent in these regions. Using immunoelectron microscopy, PG-P1 was localized in the space of Disse in nearly normal livers and was only detected on basement membranes in portal tracts. In fibrotic livers, PG-P1 in the space of Disse occasionally showed a basement-membrane-like deposition in parallel with the increased light microscopical deposition of laminin in this area, suggesting the positive participation of PG-P1 in the sinusoidal capillarization. Most capillary and sinusoidal endothelial cells, and rarely bile epithelial cells revealed the reaction products of PG-P1 in their rough endoplasmic reticulum and small vesicles. Thus, it was suggested that these cell types are mainly, if not wholly, responsible for PG-P1 production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Here we report a homozygous, 89-bp duplication in exon 34 of HSPG2 in a pair of siblings with DDSH born to consanguineous parents, and heterozygous point mutations in the 5' donor site of intron 52 and in the middle of exon 73 in a third, unrelated patient, causing skipping of the entire exons 52 and 73 of the HSPG2 transcript, respectively. These mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein core. The cartilage matrix from these patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies. Biochemically, truncated perlecan was not secreted by the patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller fragments within the cells. Thus, DDSH is caused by a functional null mutation of HSPG2.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ablation of perlecan HS/CS on murine intervertebral disc development. Genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding HS biosynthetic enzymes have identified multiple roles for HS in tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we utilised an Hspg2 exon 3 null HS/CS-deficient mouse to assess the role of perlecan HS in disc cell regulation. HS makes many important contributions to growth factor sequestration, stabilisation/delivery, and activation of receptors directing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and assembly of extracellular matrix. Perlecan HS/CS-mediated interactions promote extracellular matrix assembly/stabilisation and tissue functional properties, and thus, removal of perlecan HS/CS should affect extracellular matrix function and homeostasis. Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs accumulated significantly greater glycosaminoglycan in the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and vertebral growth plates than C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) I intervertebral discs. Proliferation of intervertebral disc progenitor cells was significantly higher in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and these cells became hypertrophic by 12 weeks of age and were prominent in the vertebral growth plates but had a disorganised organisation. C57BL/6 WT vertebral growth plates contained regular columnar growth plate chondrocytes. Exostosis-like, ectopic bone formation occurred in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and differences were evident in disc cell maturation and in matrix deposition in this genotype, indicating that perlecan HS/CS chains had cell and matrix interactive properties which repressively maintained tissue homeostasis in the adult intervertebral disc.",

Despite its obvious importance in skin repair and tissue homeostasis no definitive studies have immunolocalised TGF-\u03b21 in skin in WT or Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) perlecan exon 3 null mice. Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E).

Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes.

Perlecan has important cell regulatory and matrix organizational properties through HS mediated interactions with a range of growth factors and morphogens and with structural extracellular matrix glycoproteins which define tissue function and allow the resident cells to regulate tissue homeostasis. It was expected that ablation of the HS chains on perlecan would severely disrupt normal tendon organization and functional properties and it was envisaged that this study would better define the role of HS in normal tendon function and in tendon repair processes. Tail and Achilles tendons from each genotype were biomechanically tested (ultimate tensile stress (UTS), tensile modulus (TM)) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) compositional analyses were undertaken. Tenocytes were isolated from tail tendons from each mouse genotype and grown in monolayer culture. These cultures were undertaken in the presence of FGF-2 to assess the cell signaling properties of each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from 3-12 week old tail and Achilles tendons and qRT-PCR was undertaken to assess the expression of the following genes Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1. Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FGF-2 stimulated tenocyte monolayers displayed elevated Adamts4, Mmp2, 3, 13 mRNA levels compared to WT mice. Non-stimulated tendon Col1A1, Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1 mRNA levels showed no major differences between the two genotypes other than a decline with ageing while LTBP2 expression increased. Eln expression also declined to a greater extent in the perlecan exon 3 null mice (P < 0.05). Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This indicated a more compact form of collagen localization in the perlecan exon 3 null mice. Collagen fibrils were also smaller by TEM, which may facilitate a more condensed fibril packing accounting for the superior UTS displayed by the perlecan exon 3 null mice. The amplified catabolic phenotype of Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - mice may account for the age-dependent decline in GAG observed in tail tendon over 3 to 12 weeks. After Achilles tenotomy Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - and WT mice had similar rates of recovery of UTS and TM over 12 weeks post operatively indicating that a deficiency of HS was not detrimental to tendon repair.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ablation of perlecan HS/CS on murine intervertebral disc development. Genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding HS biosynthetic enzymes have identified multiple roles for HS in tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we utilised an Hspg2 exon 3 null HS/CS-deficient mouse to assess the role of perlecan HS in disc cell regulation. HS makes many important contributions to growth factor sequestration, stabilisation/delivery, and activation of receptors directing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and assembly of extracellular matrix. Perlecan HS/CS-mediated interactions promote extracellular matrix assembly/stabilisation and tissue functional properties, and thus, removal of perlecan HS/CS should affect extracellular matrix function and homeostasis. Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs accumulated significantly greater glycosaminoglycan in the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and vertebral growth plates than C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) I intervertebral discs. Proliferation of intervertebral disc progenitor cells was significantly higher in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and these cells became hypertrophic by 12 weeks of age and were prominent in the vertebral growth plates but had a disorganised organisation. C57BL/6 WT vertebral growth plates contained regular columnar growth plate chondrocytes. Exostosis-like, ectopic bone formation occurred in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and differences were evident in disc cell maturation and in matrix deposition in this genotype, indicating that perlecan HS/CS chains had cell and matrix interactive properties which repressively maintained tissue homeostasis in the adult intervertebral disc.",

This study examined HS content and distribution in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues in the context of potential molecular mechanisms underlying its deregulation in brain tumours. Totally, 42 tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tissues for 31 patients with different prognosis were investigated. HS expression was demonstrated in 50-55% of the GBM tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while almost no HS content was detected in the surrounding paratumourous brain tissues. Heterogeneous HS distribution in the HS-positive tumours was more related to the necrosis or glandular-like brain zones rather than glioma cells with high or low Ki-67 index. According the Kaplan-Meier curves, HS accumulation in glioma cells was associated with low relapse-free survival (RS) of the GBM patients (p < 0.05) and was likely to be due to the increased transcriptional activity of HSPG core proteins (syndecan-1, 2-3 fold; glypican-1, 2,5 fold; perlecan/HSPG2, 13-14 fold). Activation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression correlated with the patients' survival according Kaplan-Meier (p = 0.0243) and Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR = 3.1; P(Y) = 0.03) analyses, while up-regulation of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 was not associated with the patients survival. Taken together, the results indicate that increase of HS content and up-regulation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression in glioblastoma tissues contribute to tumour development through the transformation of brain extracellular matrix into tumour microenvironment, and represent negative prognostic factors for glioblastoma progression.",

Perlecan has important cell regulatory and matrix organizational properties through HS mediated interactions with a range of growth factors and morphogens and with structural extracellular matrix glycoproteins which define tissue function and allow the resident cells to regulate tissue homeostasis. It was expected that ablation of the HS chains on perlecan would severely disrupt normal tendon organization and functional properties and it was envisaged that this study would better define the role of HS in normal tendon function and in tendon repair processes. Tail and Achilles tendons from each genotype were biomechanically tested (ultimate tensile stress (UTS), tensile modulus (TM)) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) compositional analyses were undertaken. Tenocytes were isolated from tail tendons from each mouse genotype and grown in monolayer culture. These cultures were undertaken in the presence of FGF-2 to assess the cell signaling properties of each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from 3-12 week old tail and Achilles tendons and qRT-PCR was undertaken to assess the expression of the following genes Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1. Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FGF-2 stimulated tenocyte monolayers displayed elevated Adamts4, Mmp2, 3, 13 mRNA levels compared to WT mice. Non-stimulated tendon Col1A1, Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1 mRNA levels showed no major differences between the two genotypes other than a decline with ageing while LTBP2 expression increased. Eln expression also declined to a greater extent in the perlecan exon 3 null mice (P < 0.05). Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This indicated a more compact form of collagen localization in the perlecan exon 3 null mice. Collagen fibrils were also smaller by TEM, which may facilitate a more condensed fibril packing accounting for the superior UTS displayed by the perlecan exon 3 null mice. The amplified catabolic phenotype of Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - mice may account for the age-dependent decline in GAG observed in tail tendon over 3 to 12 weeks. After Achilles tenotomy Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - and WT mice had similar rates of recovery of UTS and TM over 12 weeks post operatively indicating that a deficiency of HS was not detrimental to tendon repair.",

            "abstract":"Growth factor gradients orchestrate many biological processes including organogenesis, wound healing, cancer invasion, and metastasis. Heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF) gradients are established in living systems by proteoglycans including the extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan/HSPG2. Three potential HBGF-binding glycosaminoglycan attachment sites occur in N-terminal domain I of perlecan's five domains. Our overarching goal was to form stable, biomimetic non-covalently bound HBGF gradients surrounding cells encapsulated in hyaluronate-based hydrogels by first establishing perlecan domain I (PlnD1) gradients. A versatile multichannel gradient maker device (MGMD) was designed and 3D printed, then used to create desired gradients of microparticles in hydrogels. Next, we used the device to covalently incorporate gradients of PEGylated PlnD1 in hydrogels with high-low-high or high-medium-low concentrations across the hydrogel width. Fluorescently-labeled fibroblast growth factor-2 was delivered to hydrogels in phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to electrostatically bind to the covalently pre-incorporated PlnD1, producing stable non-covalent HBGF gradients. To test cell viability after flow through the MGMD, delicate primary human salivary stem/progenitor cells were encapsulated in gradient hydrogels where they showed high viability and continued to grow. Next, to test migratory behavior in response to HBGF gradients, two cell types, preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were encapsulated in or adjacent to PlnD1-modified hydrogels. Both cell lines migrated toward HBGFs bound to PlnD1. We conclude that establishing covalently-bound PlnD1 gradients in hydrogels provides a new means to establish physiologically-relevant gradients of HBGFs that are useful for a variety of applications in tissue engineering and cancer biology. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Gradients of heparin binding growth factors (HBGFs) direct cell behavior in living systems. HBGFs bind electrostatically to gradients of HS proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix creating HBGF gradients. We recreated HBGF gradients in physiological hyaluronate-based hydrogels using a 3D-printed multichannel gradient maker device (MGMD) that created gradients of HS proteoglycan-derived perlecan/HSPG2 domain I. We demonstrated the ability of a variety of cells, including primary salivary stem/progenitor cells, pre-osteoblastic cells and an invasive breast cancer cell line, to be co-encapsulated in gradient hydrogels by flowing them together through the MGMD. The versatile device and the ability to create HBGF gradients in hydrogels for a variety of applications is innovative and of broad utility in both cancer biology and tissue engineering applications.",

It sequesters growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and regulates the ligand-receptor interactions on the cell surface, and thus it has been implicated in the control of angiogenesis. Both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of perlecan on FGF-2 signaling have been reported. To understand the in vivo function of HS carried by perlecan, the perlecan gene heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (Hspg2) was mutated in mouse by gene targeting. The HS at the NH(2) terminus of perlecan was removed while the core protein remained intact. Perlecan HS-deficient (Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3)) mice survived embryonic development and were apparently healthy as adults. However, mutant mice exhibited significantly delayed wound healing, retarded FGF-2-induced tumor growth, and defective angiogenesis. In the mouse corneal angiogenesis model, FGF-2-induced neovascularization was significantly impaired in Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mutant mice.

Despite its obvious importance in skin repair and tissue homeostasis no definitive studies have immunolocalised TGF-\u03b21 in skin in WT or Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) perlecan exon 3 null mice. Vertical parasagittal murine dorsal skin from 3, 6 and 12 week old C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and 4 \u03bcm sections stained with Mayers haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). TGF-\u03b21 was immunolocalised using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, heat retrieval and the Envision NovaRED detection system. Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes.

Exon deletion does not alter the expression or the reading frame but causes loss of attachment sites for three heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice are viable and fertile but have small eyes. Apoptosis and leakage of cellular material through the lens capsule are observed in neonatal lenses, and lenses degenerate within 3 weeks of birth. Electron microscopy revealed altered structure of the lens capsule through which cells had formed extensions. No kidney malfunction, such as protein uria, was detected in Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mutant mice, nor were ultrastructural changes observed in the glomerular basement membranes (BMs). To achieve further depletion in the HS content of the BMs, Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice were bred with collagen XVIII null mice. Lens defects were more severe in the newborn Col18a1(-/-) x Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice and degeneration proceeded faster than in Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice. The results suggest that in the lens capsule, HS chains have a structural function and are essential in the insulation of the lens from its environment and in regulation of incoming signals.",

            "abstract":"A tissue engineering approach can provide replacement salivary gland structures to patients with hyposalivation disorders and xerostomia. Salivary human stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) were isolated from healthy regions of parotid glands of head and neck surgery patients, expanded, then encapsulated in biocompatible hyaluronate (HA)-based hydrogels. These bioactive hydrogels provide a surrogate territorial matrix suitable for the dynamic assembly, growth and reorganization of salivary gland components. This study examined the dynamics of salivary microstructure formation, growth, and reorganization using time-lapse imaging over 15 h. Immunofluorescence detection monitored production of individual basement membrane components forming around developing microstructures, and Ki67 assessed proliferation. Dynamic movements in hydrogels were quantified by measuring angular velocity (\u03c9) of rotating salivary microstructures and changes in basement membrane architecture during microstructure growth. Integrin involvement in the dynamic reassembly was assessed using knockdown and inhibitor approaches. Single hS/PCs expanded over 5 days into spherical microstructures typically containing 3-10 cells. In larger macrostructures, proliferation occurred near the peripheral basement membrane that underwent growth-associated cycles of thinning and collapse. De novo secretion of laminin/collagen IV from reorganizing hS/PCs preceded that of perlecan/HSPG2. Microstructures routinely expressed \u03b21 integrin-containing complexes at basement membrane-associated regions and exhibited spontaneous and coordinated rotation during basement membrane maturation. \u03b21 integrin siRNA knockdown at the single-cell state prevented hS/PC microstructure growth. After microstructure formation, \u03b21 integrin knockdown reduced rotation and mean \u03c9 by 84%. Blockade of the \u03b11 integrin subunit (CD49a) that associates with \u03b21 reduced mean \u03c9 by 66%. Studies presented here show that initial hS/PC structure growth and basement membrane maturation depends on \u03b11\u03b21-integrin mediated signaling. Coordinated cellular motility during neotissue reorganization reminiscent of salivary gland acini was critically dependent both on hS/PC-secretion of laminin,collagen type-IV, and perlecan/HSPG2 and the force-driven interactions of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin activation. We conclude that \u03b11\u03b21-integrin plays a critical role in establishing human salivary gland coordinated structure and function, and that its activation in tissue engineered systems is essential to tissue assembly.",

This study examined HS content and distribution in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues in the context of potential molecular mechanisms underlying its deregulation in brain tumours. Totally, 42 tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tissues for 31 patients with different prognosis were investigated. HS expression was demonstrated in 50-55% of the GBM tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while almost no HS content was detected in the surrounding paratumourous brain tissues. Heterogeneous HS distribution in the HS-positive tumours was more related to the necrosis or glandular-like brain zones rather than glioma cells with high or low Ki-67 index. According the Kaplan-Meier curves, HS accumulation in glioma cells was associated with low relapse-free survival (RS) of the GBM patients (p < 0.05) and was likely to be due to the increased transcriptional activity of HSPG core proteins (syndecan-1, 2-3 fold; glypican-1, 2,5 fold; perlecan/HSPG2, 13-14 fold). Activation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression correlated with the patients' survival according Kaplan-Meier (p = 0.0243) and Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR = 3.1; P(Y) = 0.03) analyses, while up-regulation of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 was not associated with the patients survival. Taken together, the results indicate that increase of HS content and up-regulation of perlecan/HSPG2 expression in glioblastoma tissues contribute to tumour development through the transformation of brain extracellular matrix into tumour microenvironment, and represent negative prognostic factors for glioblastoma progression.",

Perlecan is the predominant HS proteoglycan in the artery wall. Here, we investigated the role of perlecan HS chains using apoE null (ApoE0) mice that were cross-bred with mice expressing HS-deficient perlecan (Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3)). Morphometry of cross-sections from aortic roots and en face preparations of whole aortas revealed a significant decrease in lesion formation in ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mice at both 15 and 33 weeks. In vitro, binding of labeled mouse triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and human LDL to total extracellular matrix, as well as to purified proteoglycans, prepared from ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) smooth muscle cells was reduced. In vivo, at 20 minutes influx of human (125)I-LDL or mouse triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into the aortic wall was increased in ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mice compared to ApoE0 mice. However, at 72 hours accumulation of (125)I-LDL was similar in ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) and ApoE0 mice. Immunohistochemistry of lesions from ApoE0/Hspg2(Delta3/Delta3) mice showed decreased staining for apoB and increased smooth muscle alpha-actin content, whereas accumulation of CD68-positive inflammatory cells was unchanged. We conclude that the perlecan HS chains are proatherogenic in mice, possibly through increased lipoprotein retention, altered vascular permeability, or other mechanisms. The ability of HS to inhibit smooth muscle cell growth may also influence development as well as instability of lesions.",

LTBP-2 was a prominent pericellular component of annular fibrochondrocytes in the posterior annulus fibrosus (AF), interstitial matrix adjacent to nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and to fibrillar and cell associated material in the anterior AF of the human foetal IVD and also displayed a pericellular localisation pattern in murine IVDs.

Fibrillin-1 was prominent in the outer anterior AF of the human foetal IVD and in fibres extending from the AF into the cartilaginous vertebral rudiments.

Primary B cells expressed a wide repertoire of PGs (dominated by serglycin and CD44) and ECM components. Lymphoblastoid EBV+ B cell lines (LCLs) showed specific PG expression with down-regulation of CD44 and ECM components and up-regulation of serglycin and perlecan/HSPG2. For Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL), serglycin was down-regulated in BL type III cells and perlecan in type I BL cells. The biosynthetic machinery for HS was active in all cell lines, with some tendency to be down-regulated in BL cells. 5'-aza-dC and/or Trichostatin A resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the genes, suggesting that low expression of ECM components, proteoglycan core proteins and HS biosynthetic system is due to epigenetic suppression in type I cells.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ablation of perlecan HS/CS on murine intervertebral disc development. Genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding HS biosynthetic enzymes have identified multiple roles for HS in tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we utilised an Hspg2 exon 3 null HS/CS-deficient mouse to assess the role of perlecan HS in disc cell regulation. HS makes many important contributions to growth factor sequestration, stabilisation/delivery, and activation of receptors directing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and assembly of extracellular matrix. Perlecan HS/CS-mediated interactions promote extracellular matrix assembly/stabilisation and tissue functional properties, and thus, removal of perlecan HS/CS should affect extracellular matrix function and homeostasis. Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs accumulated significantly greater glycosaminoglycan in the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and vertebral growth plates than C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) I intervertebral discs. Proliferation of intervertebral disc progenitor cells was significantly higher in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and these cells became hypertrophic by 12 weeks of age and were prominent in the vertebral growth plates but had a disorganised organisation. C57BL/6 WT vertebral growth plates contained regular columnar growth plate chondrocytes. Exostosis-like, ectopic bone formation occurred in Hspg2 exon 3 null intervertebral discs, and differences were evident in disc cell maturation and in matrix deposition in this genotype, indicating that perlecan HS/CS chains had cell and matrix interactive properties which repressively maintained tissue homeostasis in the adult intervertebral disc.",

Immunolocalisation of TGF-\u03b21 differed markedly in C57BL/6 and Hspg2(\u22063-/\u22063-) mouse skin, ablation of exon 3 of Hspg2 resulted in a very severe reduction in the deposition of TGF-\u03b21 in skin 3-12 weeks postnatally. The reduced deposition of TGF-\u03b21 observed in the present study would be expected to impact detrimentally on the remodelling and healing capacity of skin in mutant mice compounding on the poor wound-healing properties already reported for perlecan exon 3 null mice due to an inability to signal with FGF-2 and promote angiogenic repair processes. TGF-\u03b21 also has cell mediated effects in tissue homeostasis and matrix stabilisation a reduction in TGF-\u03b21 deposition would therefore be expected to detrimentally impact on skin homeostasis in the perlecan mutant mice.",

            "abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the role of the perlecan (Hspg2) heparan sulphate (HS) side chains on cell and matrix homeostasis in tail and Achilles tendons in 3 and 12 week old Hspg2 exon 3 null HS deficient (Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 -) and C57 BL/6 Wild Type (WT) mice. Perlecan has important cell regulatory and matrix organizational properties through HS mediated interactions with a range of growth factors and morphogens and with structural extracellular matrix glycoproteins which define tissue function and allow the resident cells to regulate tissue homeostasis. It was expected that ablation of the HS chains on perlecan would severely disrupt normal tendon organization and functional properties and it was envisaged that this study would better define the role of HS in normal tendon function and in tendon repair processes. Tail and Achilles tendons from each genotype were biomechanically tested (ultimate tensile stress (UTS), tensile modulus (TM)) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) compositional analyses were undertaken. Tenocytes were isolated from tail tendons from each mouse genotype and grown in monolayer culture. These cultures were undertaken in the presence of FGF-2 to assess the cell signaling properties of each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from 3-12 week old tail and Achilles tendons and qRT-PCR was undertaken to assess the expression of the following genes Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1. Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FGF-2 stimulated tenocyte monolayers displayed elevated Adamts4, Mmp2, 3, 13 mRNA levels compared to WT mice. Non-stimulated tendon Col1A1, Vcan, Bgn, Dcn, Lum, Hspg2, Ltbp1, Ltbp2, Eln and Fbn1 mRNA levels showed no major differences between the two genotypes other than a decline with ageing while LTBP2 expression increased. Eln expression also declined to a greater extent in the perlecan exon 3 null mice (P < 0.05). Type VI collagen and perlecan were immunolocalised in tail tendon and collagen fibrils imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This indicated a more compact form of collagen localization in the perlecan exon 3 null mice. Collagen fibrils were also smaller by TEM, which may facilitate a more condensed fibril packing accounting for the superior UTS displayed by the perlecan exon 3 null mice. The amplified catabolic phenotype of Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - mice may account for the age-dependent decline in GAG observed in tail tendon over 3 to 12 weeks. After Achilles tenotomy Hspg2\u03943 - \u2215\u03943 - and WT mice had similar rates of recovery of UTS and TM over 12 weeks post operatively indicating that a deficiency of HS was not detrimental to tendon repair.",

Apoptosis and leakage of cellular material through the lens capsule are observed in neonatal lenses, and lenses degenerate within 3 weeks of birth. Electron microscopy revealed altered structure of the lens capsule through which cells had formed extensions. No kidney malfunction, such as protein uria, was detected in Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mutant mice, nor were ultrastructural changes observed in the glomerular basement membranes (BMs). To achieve further depletion in the HS content of the BMs, Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice were bred with collagen XVIII null mice. Lens defects were more severe in the newborn Col18a1(-/-) x Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice and degeneration proceeded faster than in Hspg2(Delta 3 / Delta 3) mice.

Salivary human stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) were isolated from healthy regions of parotid glands of head and neck surgery patients, expanded, then encapsulated in biocompatible hyaluronate (HA)-based hydrogels. These bioactive hydrogels provide a surrogate territorial matrix suitable for the dynamic assembly, growth and reorganization of salivary gland components. This study examined the dynamics of salivary microstructure formation, growth, and reorganization using time-lapse imaging over 15 h. Immunofluorescence detection monitored production of individual basement membrane components forming around developing microstructures, and Ki67 assessed proliferation. Dynamic movements in hydrogels were quantified by measuring angular velocity (\u03c9) of rotating salivary microstructures and changes in basement membrane architecture during microstructure growth. Integrin involvement in the dynamic reassembly was assessed using knockdown and inhibitor approaches. Single hS/PCs expanded over 5 days into spherical microstructures typically containing 3-10 cells. In larger macrostructures, proliferation occurred near the peripheral basement membrane that underwent growth-associated cycles of thinning and collapse. De novo secretion of laminin/collagen IV from reorganizing hS/PCs preceded that of perlecan/HSPG2. Microstructures routinely expressed \u03b21 integrin-containing complexes at basement membrane-associated regions and exhibited spontaneous and coordinated rotation during basement membrane maturation. \u03b21 integrin siRNA knockdown at the single-cell state prevented hS/PC microstructure growth. After microstructure formation, \u03b21 integrin knockdown reduced rotation and mean \u03c9 by 84%. Blockade of the \u03b11 integrin subunit (CD49a) that associates with \u03b21 reduced mean \u03c9 by 66%. Studies presented here show that initial hS/PC structure growth and basement membrane maturation depends on \u03b11\u03b21-integrin mediated signaling. Coordinated cellular motility during neotissue reorganization reminiscent of salivary gland acini was critically dependent both on hS/PC-secretion of laminin,collagen type-IV, and perlecan/HSPG2 and the force-driven interactions of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin activation.

            "abstract":"Perlecan/HSPG2, a large heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, normally is expressed in the basement membrane (BM) underlying epithelial and endothelial cells. During prostate cancer (PCa) cell invasion, a variety of proteolytic enzymes are expressed that digest BM components including perlecan. An enzyme upregulated in invasive PCa cells, matrilysin/matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), was examined as a candidate for perlecan proteolysis both in silico and in vitro. Purified perlecan showed high sensitivity to MMP-7 digestion even when fully decorated with HS or when presented in native context connected with other BM proteins. In both conditions, MMP-7 produced discrete perlecan fragments corresponding to an origin in immunoglobulin (Ig) repeat region domain IV. While not predicted by in silico analysis, MMP-7 cleaved every subpart of recombinantly generated perlecan domain IV. Other enzymes relevant to PCa that were tested had limited ability to cleave perlecan including prostate specific antigen, hepsin, or fibroblast activation protein \u03b1. A long C-terminal portion of perlecan domain IV, Dm IV-3, induced a strong clustering phenotype in the metastatic PCa cell lines, PC-3 and C4-2. MMP-7 digestion of Dm IV-3 reverses the clustering effect into one favoring cell dispersion. In a C4-2 Transwell\u00ae invasion assay, perlecan-rich human BM extract that was pre-digested with MMP-7 showed loss of barrier function and permitted a greater level of cell penetration than untreated BM extract. We conclude that enzymatic processing of perlecan in the BM or territorial matrix by MMP-7 as occurs in the invasive tumor microenvironment acts as a molecular switch to alter PCa cell behavior and favor cell dispersion and invasiveness.",

The intact proteoglycan inhibits the smooth muscle cell (SMC) response to vascular injury. Hspg2(\u03943/\u03943) (M\u03943/\u03943) mice produce a mutant perlecan lacking the HS side chains. The objective of this study was to determine differences between these two types of perlecan in modifying SMC activities to the arterial injury response, in order to define the specific role of the HS side chains. In vitro proliferative and migratory activities were compared in SMC isolated from M\u03943/\u03943 and wild-type mice. Proliferation of M\u03943/\u03943 SMC was 1.5\u00d7 greater than in wild type (P < 0.001), increased by addition of growth factors, and showed a 42% greater migratory response than wild-type cells to PDGF-BB (P < 0.001). In M\u03943/\u03943 SMC adhesion to fibronectin, and collagen types I and IV was significantly greater than wild type. Addition of DRL-12582, an inducer of perlecan expression, decreased proliferation and migratory response to PDGF-BB stimulation in wild-type SMC compared with M\u03943/\u03943. In an in vivo carotid artery wire injury model, the medial thickness, medial area/lumen ratio, and macrophage infiltration were significantly increased in the M\u03943/\u03943 mice, indicating a prominent role of the HS side chain in limiting vascular injury response. Mutant perlecan that lacks HS side chains had a marked reduction in the inhibition of in vitro SMC function and the in vivo arterial response to injury, indicating the critical role of HS side chains in perlecan function in the vessel wall.",

Primary B cells expressed a wide repertoire of PGs (dominated by serglycin and CD44) and ECM components. Lymphoblastoid EBV+ B cell lines (LCLs) showed specific PG expression with down-regulation of CD44 and ECM components and up-regulation of serglycin and perlecan/HSPG2. For Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL), serglycin was down-regulated in BL type III cells and perlecan in type I BL cells. The biosynthetic machinery for HS was active in all cell lines, with some tendency to be down-regulated in BL cells. 5'-aza-dC and/or Trichostatin A resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the genes, suggesting that low expression of ECM components, proteoglycan core proteins and HS biosynthetic system is due to epigenetic suppression in type I cells. Taken together, our data show that proteoglycans are expressed in primary B lymphocytes whereas they are not or only partly expressed in EBV-carrying cell lines, depending on their latency type program.",

            "abstract":"Our recent studies demonstrated that apolipoprotein E mediates cell attachment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) through interactions with the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS). HS is known to covalently attach to core proteins to form heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface. The HSPG core proteins include the membrane-spanning syndecans (SDCs), the lycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glypicans (GPCs), the basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan (HSPG2), and agrin. In the present study, we have profiled each of the HSPG core proteins in HCV attachment. Substantial evidence derived from our studies demonstrates that SDC1 is the major receptor protein for HCV attachment. The knockdown of SDC1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced gene silence resulted in a significant reduction of HCV attachment to Huh-7.5 cells and stem cell-differentiated human hepatocytes. The silence of SDC2 expression also caused a modest decrease of HCV attachment. In contrast, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of other SDCs, GPCs, HSPG2, and agrin had no effect on HCV attachment. More importantly, ectopic expression of SDC1 was able to completely restore HCV attachment to Huh-7.5 cells in which the endogenous SDC1 expression was silenced by specific siRNAs. Interestingly, mouse SDC1 is also fully functional in mediating HCV attachment when expressed in the SDC1-deficient cells, consistent with recent reports that mouse hepatocytes are also susceptible to HCV infection when expressing other key HCV receptors. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SDC1 serves as the major receptor protein for HCV attachment to cells, providing another potential target for discovery and development of antiviral drugs against HCV.",

            "abstract":"Endochondral bone formation is a highly orchestrated process involving coordination among cell-cell, cell-matrix and growth factor signaling that eventually results in the production of mineralized bone from a cartilage template. Chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation occur in sequence during this process, and the temporospatial patterning clearly requires the activities of heparin binding growth factors and their receptors. Heparanase (HPSE) plays a role in osteogenesis, but the mechanism by which it does so is incompletely understood. We used a combination of ex vivo and in vitro approaches and a well described HPSE inhibitor, PI-88 to study HPSE in endochondral bone formation. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization with HPSE antibodies revealed that HPSE is expressed in the peri-chondrium, peri-osteum, and at the chondro-osseous junction, all sites of key signaling events and tissue morphogenesis. Transcripts encoding Hpse also were observed in the pre-hypertrophic zone. Addition of PI-88 to metatarsals in organ culture reduced growth and suggested that HPSE activity aids the transition from chondrogenic to osteogenic processes in growth of long bones. To study this, we used high density cultures of ATDC5 pre-chondrogenic cells grown under conditions favoring chondrogenesis or osteogenesis. Under chondrogenic conditions, HPSE/Hpse was expressed at high levels during the mid-culture period, at the onset of terminal chondrogenesis. PI-88 addition reduced chondrogenesis and accelerated osteogenesis, including a dramatic up-regulation of osteocalcin levels. In normal growth medium, addition of PI-88 reduced migration of ATDC-5 cells, suggesting that HPSE facilitates cartilage replacement by bone at the chondro-osseous junction by removing the HS component of proteoglycans, such as perlecan/HSPG2, that otherwise prevent osteogenic cells from remodeling hypertrophic cartilage.",

Here we report a homozygous, 89-bp duplication in exon 34 of HSPG2 in a pair of siblings with DDSH born to consanguineous parents, and heterozygous point mutations in the 5' donor site of intron 52 and in the middle of exon 73 in a third, unrelated patient, causing skipping of the entire exons 52 and 73 of the HSPG2 transcript, respectively. These mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein core. The cartilage matrix from these patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies. Biochemically, truncated perlecan was not secreted by the patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller fragments within the cells. Thus, DDSH is caused by a functional null mutation of HSPG2.

SLC associates with BILL-Cadherin and other glycoproteins to form the pro-B cell receptor (pro-BCR) at the pre-BI cell stage, and with the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain to form the pre-BCR at the pre-BII cell stage. The function of the pro-BCR, if any, is unknown, whereas the pre-BCR is crucial for proliferative expansion of pre-BII cells. To shed light on the functional properties of VpreB1 and VpreB2 in vivo, mice with either one or two VpreB1, or one or two VpreB2, alleles have been investigated. We show that B cell development in mice with two VpreB1 alleles is indistinguishable from that of normal mice. In contrast, mice with two VpreB2 alleles show an approximately 1.6-fold increase in pre-BI and a 35% decrease in pre-BII cell numbers, while mice with only one VpreB2 allele show a reduction in B cell development manifested in a 2-fold enrichment in pre-BI cells and a 75% reduction in pre-BII cells. However, such a gene dosage effect is not observed for VpreB1. Our results suggest that the difference between VpreB1- and VpreB2-deficient mice is due to lower VpreB2 protein expression, thus limiting the formation of pre-BCRs and thereby the number of large, cycling pre-BII cells.",

Here, we analyze its specificity in vivo by generating transgenic mice in which expression of a reporter gene (human CD122) is regulated by the VpreB1 enhancer in the context of its own promoter. All transgenic lines expressed the reporter gene in the bone marrow in a copy number-independent manner, whereas expression levels were integration site-dependent. While the enhancer is not tissue specific, within the B cell lineage the expression pattern of human CD122 mimicked that of endogenous VpreB1. Thus, low levels were detected in pro-B cells, high levels in pre-BI and slightly lower levels in pre-BII cells; no expression was detected in immature/mature B cells. Furthermore, when in vitro cultured transgenic pre-B cells differentiated into immature B cells there was concomitant down-regulation of human CD122 and endogenous VpreB1.

Molecular and cytogenetic analyses of B-ALL revealed recurrent genetic and structural genomic alterations which are routinely applied for diagnosis, prognosis and choice of treatment regimen. The present case report describes a 4-year-old female diagnosed with B-ALL. GTG-banding at low resolution revealed an abnormal clone with 46,XX,?t(X;19)(q13;q13.3),der(9) besides normal cells. Molecular cytogenetics demonstrated a balanced translocation between chromosomes 16 and 19, and an unbalanced translocation involving chromosomes 5 and 9. A locus-specific probe additionally identified that the FUS gene in 16p11.2 was split and its 5' region was translocated to subband 19q13.33, whereas the 3' region of the FUS gene remained on the derivative chromosome 16. Overall, this complex karyotype included four different chromosomes and five break events. Further analyses, including array-comparative genomic hybridization, additionally revealed biallelic deletion of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A/B, and deletion of the NR3C1 and VPREB1 genes.

Biocytin may be injected into the brain by iontophoresis or by pressure injection methods, and localized in tissue sections using avidin-conjugated labels. It is taken up by neurons and rapidly transported down axons in an anterograde fashion. Axons are completely labeled in a Golgi-like manner and can be examined at both light and electron microscopic levels. Biocytin can also be used in retrograde tract tracing experiments, although in some cases it appears that fibers must be damaged to produce such labeling. Retrogradely labeled cells may be completely labeled, resembling neurons stained with the Golgi technique. Individual neurons can also be labeled in a Golgi-like manner by uptake of biocytin from the extracellular space. Thus, it appears that biocytin is an especially versatile marker for neuroanatomical investigations.",

The inclusion of biocytin/neurobiotin in the recording electrode permits post-hoc recovery of morphological details, which are necessary to determine the dendritic arborization and the regions targeted by the axons of the recorded neurons. However, given the presence of morphologically similar neurons with distinct neurochemical identities and functions, immunohistochemical staining for cell-type-specific proteins is essential to definitively identify neurons. To maintain network connectivity, brain sections for physiological recordings are prepared at a thickness of 300 \u00b5m or greater. However, this thickness often hinders immunohistological postprocessing due to issues with antibody penetration, necessitating the resectioning of the tissue. Resectioning of slices is a challenging art, often resulting in the loss of tissue and morphology of the cells from which electrophysiological data was obtained, rendering the data unusable. Since recovery of morphology would limit data loss and guide in the selection of neuronal markers, we have adopted a strategy of recovering cell morphology first, followed by secondary immunostaining. We introduce a practical approach to biocytin filling during physiological recordings and subsequent serial immunostaining for the recovery of morphology, followed by the restaining of sections to determine the neurochemical identity. We report that sections that were filled with biocytin, fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA), stained, and coverslipped can be removed and restained with a second primary antibody days later. This restaining involves the removal of the coverslip, the washing of sections in a buffer solution, and the incubation of primary and secondary antibodies to reveal the neurochemical identity. The method is advantageous for eliminating data loss due to an inability to recover morphology and for narrowing down the neurochemical markers to be tested based on morphology.",

We provide a detailed dehydration and embedding protocol using Eukitt that avoids the common problem of tissue distortion and therefore prevents fading of cytoarchitectural features (in particular, lamination) of brain tissue; as a result, additional labeling methods (such as cytochrome oxidase staining) become unnecessary. In addition, we provide correction factors for tissue shrinkage in all spatial dimensions so that a realistic neuronal morphology can be obtained from slice preparations. Such corrections were hitherto difficult to calculate because embedding in viscous media resulted in highly nonlinear tissue deformation.

This process is accompanied by many changes in fundamental cell properties, such as energy production, cell-to-cell interactions, cytoskeletal organization, and others. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) can be used as a quantitative method of gene expression analysis to investigate iPS reprogramming but it requires a validation of reference genes for the accurate assessment of target genes' expression. Currently, studies evaluating the performance of reference genes during iPS reprogramming are lacking. In this study we analysed the stability of 12 housekeeping genes during 20 days of iPS reprogramming of murine cells based on statistical analyses of RT-qPCR data using five different statistical algorithms. This study reports strong variations in housekeeping gene stability during the reprogramming process. Most stable genes were Atp5f1, Pgk1 and Gapdh, while the least stable genes were Rps18, Hprt, Tbp and Actb. The results were validated by a proof-of-point qPCR experiment with pluripotent markers Nanog, Rex1 and Oct4 normalized to the best and the worst reference gene identified by the analyses. Overall, this study and its implications are particularly relevant to investigations on the cell-state and pluripotency in iPS reprogramming.",

Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital malformations, in particular craniofacial, upper limb, heart, and urinary system defects that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. DBA has been associated with mutations in seven ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7, in about 43% of patients. To continue our large-scale screen of RP genes in a DBA population, we sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes, RPL15, RPL24, RPL29, RPL32, RPL34, RPL9, RPL37, RPS14, RPS23, RPL10A, RPS10, RPS12, RPS18, RPL30, RPS20, RPL12, RPL7A, RPS6, RPL27A, RPLP2, RPS25, RPS3, RPL41, RPL6, RPLP0, RPS26, RPL21, RPL36AL, RPS29, RPL4, RPLP1, RPL13, RPS15A, RPS2, and RPL38, in our DBA patient cohort of 117 probands. We identified three distinct mutations of RPS10 in five probands and nine distinct mutations of RPS26 in 12 probands. Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients bearing mutations in RPS10 and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA. This accumulation is consistent with the phenotype observed in HeLa cells after knockdown of RPS10 or RPS26 expression with siRNAs, which indicates that mutations in the RPS10 and RPS26 genes in DBA patients affect the function of the proteins in rRNA processing.",

Phylogenetic analyses based on these four sequences gave consistent results and strongly supported the monophyly hypothesis for the genus Pinus and its two recognized subgenera. Pinus krempfii, the two-flat-needle pine endemic to Vietnam, was placed in subgen. Strobus and showed closer affinity to subsect. Gerardianae. The ancient character of sect. Parrya is further confirmed. However, monophyly of the sect. Parrya is not supported by our data. Among the Eurasian pines of subgen.

Liver, brain, intestine and muscle samples from both groups had qRT-PCR results analyzed by dCt, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder softwares. Consensus analyses among software concluded that rpl13\u03b1, rpl7, and eef1a1 are the most stable genes for zebrafish, considering the studied groups and tissues. Gapdh, rps18, and tuba1 suffered variations in stability among different tissues of both groups, and so, they were listed as the genes with lowest stability. Results from an average pairwise variations test indicated that the use of two RGs would generate reliable results for gene expression analysis in the studied tissues.

This process is accompanied by many changes in fundamental cell properties, such as energy production, cell-to-cell interactions, cytoskeletal organization, and others. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) can be used as a quantitative method of gene expression analysis to investigate iPS reprogramming but it requires a validation of reference genes for the accurate assessment of target genes' expression. Currently, studies evaluating the performance of reference genes during iPS reprogramming are lacking. In this study we analysed the stability of 12 housekeeping genes during 20 days of iPS reprogramming of murine cells based on statistical analyses of RT-qPCR data using five different statistical algorithms. This study reports strong variations in housekeeping gene stability during the reprogramming process. Most stable genes were Atp5f1, Pgk1 and Gapdh, while the least stable genes were Rps18, Hprt, Tbp and Actb. The results were validated by a proof-of-point qPCR experiment with pluripotent markers Nanog, Rex1 and Oct4 normalized to the best and the worst reference gene identified by the analyses. Overall, this study and its implications are particularly relevant to investigations on the cell-state and pluripotency in iPS reprogramming.",

Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital malformations, in particular craniofacial, upper limb, heart, and urinary system defects that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. DBA has been associated with mutations in seven ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7, in about 43% of patients.

Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients bearing mutations in RPS10 and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA. This accumulation is consistent with the phenotype observed in HeLa cells after knockdown of RPS10 or RPS26 expression with siRNAs, which indicates that mutations in the RPS10 and RPS26 genes in DBA patients affect the function of the proteins in rRNA processing.",

The present study conducted a meta\u2011analysis of a pool of 646 expression profile data sets from 54 different human tissues and identified actin \u03b3 1 as the HK gene that best fits the combination of all the traditional criteria to be used as a reference gene for general use; two ribosomal protein genes, RPS18 and RPS27, and one aquaporin gene, POM121 transmembrane nucleporin C, were also identified. The present study provided a list of tissue\u2011 and organ\u2011specific genes that may be most suited for the following individual tissues/organs: Adipose tissue, bone marrow, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, skeletal muscle and testis; and also provides in these cases a representative, quantitative portrait of the relative, typical gene\u2011expression profile in the form of searchable database tables.",

The total aligned sequence length is 3570 bp. Of the four sequences examined, matK evolved much faster than rbcL in Pinus and in other Pinaceae genera. The two noncoding regions did not show more divergence than the two coding regions, especially within each Pinus subgenus. Phylogenetic analyses based on these four sequences gave consistent results and strongly supported the monophyly hypothesis for the genus Pinus and its two recognized subgenera. Pinus krempfii, the two-flat-needle pine endemic to Vietnam, was placed in subgen. Strobus and showed closer affinity to subsect. Gerardianae. The ancient character of sect. Parrya is further confirmed. However, monophyly of the sect. Parrya is not supported by our data. Among the Eurasian pines of subgen. Pinus, Mediterranean pines formed one clade and the Asian members of subsect. Sylvestres formed another. The Himalayan P. roxburghii showed considerable divergence from all the other hard pines from both regions. Pinus merkusii was distinctly separated from all the Asian members of subsect. Sylvestres. The implications of our results for Pinus classification are discussed.",

Liver, brain, intestine and muscle samples from both groups had qRT-PCR results analyzed by dCt, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder softwares. Consensus analyses among software concluded that rpl13\u03b1, rpl7, and eef1a1 are the most stable genes for zebrafish, considering the studied groups and tissues. Gapdh, rps18, and tuba1 suffered variations in stability among different tissues of both groups, and so, they were listed as the genes with lowest stability. Results from an average pairwise variations test indicated that the use of two RGs would generate reliable results for gene expression analysis in the studied tissues. We conclude that genes that are commonly used in mammals for qRT-PCR assays have low stability in both non-transgenic and gh-transgenic zebrafish reinforcing the importance of using species-specific RGs.",

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed frequent amplification at 13q34, where we had detected amplification in several other types of tumor, including esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESC). Previously, we suggested possible involvement of TFDP1, encoding a transcription factor DP-1, in the 13q34 amplification observed in a primary ESC. Therefore, we investigated amplifications and expression levels of 5 genes mapped on the amplified region, including TFDP1, for exploring amplification targets at 13q34 in HCCs. 3 of those genes, TFDP1, CUL4A (cullin 4A), and CDC16 (cell division cycle 16), showed distinct amplification and consequent over-expression in some cell lines. Moreover, each was amplified in 3 or 4 of the 51 primary HCCs, and all 3 were amplified in 2 tumors, in which their expression patterns correlated with amplification patterns. To elucidate the functional role of TFDP1 in HCC, we examined expression levels of genes downstream of TFDP1 with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression of cyclin E gene (CCNE1) correlated closely with that of TFDP1 in not only cell lines, but also primary tumors. Treatment of HCC cells with the antisense oligonucleotide targeting TFDP1 resulted in down-regulation of CCNE1, suggesting that TFDP1 overexpression led to up-regulation of CCNE1 that encoded a positive regulator for cell cycle G1/S transition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TFDP1, CUL4A, and CDC16 are probable targets of an amplification mechanism and therefore may be involved, together or separately, in development and/or progression of some HCCs.",

Recent advances (discoveries of molecular biomarkers) provide new opportunities for the treatment of GBM. The aim of the present study was to identify diagnostic biomarkers of high-grade GBM. First, we combined 3 microarray expression datasets to screen them for genes differentially expressed in patients with high-grade GBM relative to healthy subjects. Next, the target network was constructed via the empirical Bayesian coexpression approach, and centrality analysis and a molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm were performed to explore hub genes and functional modules. Finally, a validation test was conducted to verify the bioinformatic results. A total of 277 differentially expressed genes were identified according to the criteria P < 0.05 and |log2(fold change)| \u2265 1.5. These genes were most significantly enriched in the cell cycle pathway. Centrality analysis uncovered 9 hub genes; among them, TFDP1 showed the highest degree of connectivity (43) and is a known participant in the cell cycle pathway; this finding pointed to the important role of TFDP1 in the progression of high-grade GBM. Experimental validation mostly supported the bioinformatic results.

            "abstract":"Abstract Re-sequencing of target genes is a highly effective approach for identifying mutations in cancers. Mutations, including indels (insertions, deletions, and the combination of the two), play important roles in carcinogenesis. Combining genomic DNA capture using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (NimbleGen, Inc.) with next-generation high-throughput sequencing, we identified approximately 1600 indels for colorectal cancers in the Chinese population. Among them, 5 indels were localized to exonic regions of genes, including the TFDP1 (transcription factor Dp-1) gene. TFDP1 is an important transcription factor that coordinates with E2F proteins, thereby promoting transcription of E2F target genes and regulating the cell cycle and differentiation. We report here the identification of a recurrent frame-shift indel mutation (named indel84) in the TFDP1 gene in colorectal cancers by next-generation sequencing. We found in a validation set that TFDP1 indel84 is present in 70% of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. Wild-type TFDP1 encodes a protein of 410 amino acids with a potential DNA binding site at its N-terminal followed by several functional protein domains. The TFDP1 indel cDNA would generate an alternative TFDP1 protein missing the first 120 amino acids and potentially affecting the DNA binding domain. We further demonstrated that the TFDP1 indel84 mutation generated a gain-of-function phenotype by increasing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. Our study identified a key molecular event for CRC that might have great diagnostic and therapeutic potentials.",

            "abstract":"Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) control cell identity by establishing facultative heterochromatin repressive domains at common sets of target genes. PRC1, which deposits H2Aub1 through the E3 ligases RING1A/B, forms six biochemically distinct subcomplexes depending on the assembled PCGF protein (PCGF1-PCGF6); however, it is yet unclear whether these subcomplexes have also specific activities. Here we show that PCGF1 and PCGF2 largely compensate for each other, while other PCGF proteins have high levels of specificity for distinct target genes. PCGF2 associates with transcription repression, whereas PCGF3 and PCGF6 associate with actively transcribed genes. Notably, PCGF3 and PCGF6 complexes can assemble and be recruited to several active sites independently of RING1A/B activity (therefore, of PRC1). For chromatin recruitment, the PCGF6 complex requires the combinatorial activities of its MGA-MAX and E2F6-DP1 subunits, while PCGF3 requires an interaction with the USF1 DNA binding transcription factor.",

            "abstract":"DP-1 is a heterodimerization partner for members of the E2F family of transcription factors; E2F/DP-1 regulates the expression of various cellular promoters, particularly gene products that are involved in the cell cycle. Our earlier studies identified the DP-1 gene ( TFDP1) as a probable target within a 13q34 amplicon that is frequently detected in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of up-regulation of TFDP1 in HCC. We determined expression levels of TFDP1 and E2F1 in 41 primary HCCs by means of quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions, and looked for relationships between those data and various clinicopathological parameters. To assess transactivating activity of E2F1/DP-1, we also analyzed expression of ten putative transcriptional targets of this complex in HCCs. Using antisense oligonucleotides, we down-regulated TFDP1 in Hep3B, an HCC cell line that had shown overexpression of the gene, to examine the role of elevated TFDP1 expression in the growth of Hep3B cells. Elevated expression of TFDP1, but not E2F1, was associated significantly with large (> or =5 cm) tumor size (P=0.021). Expression levels of TFDP1 and E2F1 correlated with those of seven transcriptional targets ( TYMS, DHFR, PCNA, RRM1, CCNE1, CDC2, and MYBL2) that play important roles in the G1/S transition, and down-regulation of TFDP1 inhibited growth of Hep3B cells. In conclusion, overexpression of TFDP1 may contribute to progression of some HCCs by promoting growth of the tumor cells.",
